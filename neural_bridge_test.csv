"Twitter is one of key tools in my platform toolbox. It represents about 21 percent of my blog referral traffic. In terms of the return, I don’t know of a better investment.
Currently, I have more than 110,000 followers on Twitter. According to TwitterCounter and RetweetRank:
- I am adding 73 new followers per day.
- I am re-tweeted 260 times per day.
- My total daily reach is 418,908.
Yet, I spend less than thirty minutes a day on Twitter. I don’t know where else I could impact that many people with so little effort.
The key is using the right strategy and the right tools. Here’s what my daily routine looks like, Monday through Friday. (All times are CST.)
- Post links to my current blog post. At 6:00 a.m. I tweet a link to my newest blog post, using Buffer’s “Post Now” function.
At the same time, I schedule another promotional tweet for 11:20 a.m. using HootSuite. These two actions take less than a minute.
- Review and reply to overnight activity. As soon as I am done with the previous tasks, I scan my “streams” (i.e., columns) in HootSuite for messages, mentions, and interesting tweets that might have been posted overnight. I then reply or retweet as appropriate. This usually takes me five minutes, max.
- Create tweets with links to interesting news and blog posts. Once I have completed the previous task, I begin reading the days news and blog posts. I refer to this as “content foraging.” I am looking for articles to share with my followers.
I scan more than two hundred news and blog feeds a day, using Google Reader. Note: I do not read two hundred feeds. I only scan, looking for headlines that catch my interest. If they do, I read the article or post.
If I think my followers will benefit from the content, I click the Buffer icon in Chrome (my browser). It automatically grabs the post title and creates a link to it using my custom URL shortener. I usually add a comment and then add it to my Buffer.
My goal is to find 10–12 articles I can share. Buffer is the foundation of my Twitter strategy. It assigns each tweet to the next available slot in my pre-determined Tweeting Schedule.
I only spend about thirty minutes reading like this. Creating the tweets probably takes ten minutes of this time, as I am doing it in real time as I come across a post I think my followers will enjoy.
- Review and reply to daily activity. Throughout the day, as I have the opportunity, I will check my streams in HootSuite. I do this during breaks, so it doesn’t interrupt my workflow. (Recently, I heard these breaks referred to as the equivalent of the old smoking break. Remember those?)
HootSuite makes it easy to segment my attention. I have my streams arranged in HootSuite from left to right, with the streams I want to spend the most time on in the left-most column.
In other words, I look at my direct messages first, then my mentions and replies, then my family, my community leaders, friends, sources, etc.
This probably takes me another 15 minutes, depending on what else I have going on that day.
In addition, I bulk-schedule tweets to the most popular posts in my blog archive, using SocialOomph. I have ninety total tweets I use for this. I have set it up, so that the program posts one tweet per day at 6:00 p.m. (It also posts to my various Facebook fan pages.)
This may seem like a lot of activity. But again, using the right tools, I can do all this in about thirty minutes a day. I think the impact is well-worth the investment.
Please note: I reserve the right to delete comments that are snarky, offensive, or off-topic. If in doubt, read My Comments Policy.",What is the daily routine of the Twitter user mentioned in the context?,"The daily routine includes posting links to the current blog post early in the morning, reviewing and replying to overnight activity, creating tweets with links to interesting news and blog posts, reviewing and replying to daily activity throughout the day, and bulk-scheduling tweets to the most popular posts in the blog archive. All these activities are done using various tools like Buffer, HootSuite, and SocialOomph, and the total time spent on Twitter is less than thirty minutes a day."
"In 2010, it’s officially beyond a doubt that “cougar” is a part of our cultural lexicon. That’s especially true now that the 40-years-and-older women who date younger men have their own beauty pageant.
Los Angeles resident CC Perkinson was crowned Miss Cougar 2010 Del Mar last week in the second annual contest. The LA Weekly reports she received over 1,600 votes via Twitter and texting, beating out 24 other women for the, um, prestigious title.
My first reaction, as a feminist, is to roll my eyes. The concept of women lining up to be be judged in a “beauty” competition is offensive enough, as is the widespread exclusion of trans women from pageants and, for that matter, men. Then there’s the term cougar itself, which implies that an older woman who pursues hot young men is just like a predatory animal that can maul and eat you. Ouch.
And yet, some women are now happily embracing the cougar title and crown. Are we seeing cougar shift from negative connotations to positive ones? The Del Mar pageant rules benignly define cougar as “a mature woman who pursues younger men, typically more than eight years her junior.”
Miss Cougar 2010, CC Perkinson, actually seems pretty badass. Perkinson was a Del Mar jockey from 1998 to 2005, so gets big kudos right there for being a woman working in a physically demanding, male-dominated industry. (Perhaps that was a point in her favor: Oddly enough, the Del Mar Cougar pageant is actually named after a horse: hall-of-fame racehorse Cougar II.) After winning the pageant, she told NBC Los Angeles:
You can learn from the older, you can learn from the younger and you can have such a great time, and that’s what this is about.
In a culture that remains uncomfortable with unmarried women, it’s nice to hear a positive take on aging-while-female. Perkinson added:
You’ve got to get it in your mind you’ve got a lot to offer. It empowers women to keep a healthy mind, keep a healthy body, reinvent yourself and realize there’s men out there that are attracted to you.
So what do you think: Is cougar inherently offensive? Or can it be reclaimed?

Dating younger men, OK. The term, not so OK.
I am THREE (count 'em, 3) years older than my husband and I have had the term ""cougar"" applied to me. It's ridiculous.
What's the term for men who date younger women? It's ""men"". We don't need to apply a special term to women who date younger men.
I didn't mind the term when it first came out. I actually saw it as a term of empowerment and ownership of one's sexuality. Then it became popular and (like everything else) the more people used it, the more annoying it became and lost any meaning of power. That said, I do think it is more akin to the term ""meterosexual"". It is more annoying and overused than anything although of course it has sexist/homophobic undertones.
I have heard that Larry King, Michael Douglas and other older men don't get the same label which, to an extent, could be true. That said, I have always had a term for men such as this – Dirty Old Man. It isn't exactly a term of endearment.
Kay —
It's true, we do have the terms ""dirty old man"" and ""lech"" to refer to older men who date younger women — but those are usually applied in cases where the guy is MUCH older — like old enough to be her parent. Larry King, for example, is 26 years older than his current wife. But when was the last time you heard those kinds of terms applied to the likes of Brad Pitt, who is 11 years older than Angelina Jolie? If she were the older of the two, the media would have undoubtedly pointed it out ad nauseum, whereas in his case it's just accepted as the normal order of things.
Cougar comes from the effect of a radical face lift. The skin is pulled back from the jaw and cheeks , making the cheekbones very prominent. Eyelids are elongated and slightly tilted. The look isn’t quite human, more feline. Check out what a cougar’s face looks like.
I agree that the term ""cougar"" is given to women unfairly and I applaud women who are trying to redefine it. Unfortunately, I think it will be a long time before the word will be a positive term.
There’s nothing wrong with an older woman dating, having a relationship with, or marrying a younger man. Men have been doing it for centuries. It’s time for us woman to do what makes us happy and not be concerned about what others may think.
I think the word is loosing its teeth and its no depiction of the true person who is attracted to the younger man….attraction is a matter of preferance.",Who was crowned Miss Cougar 2010 Del Mar?,CC Perkinson was crowned Miss Cougar 2010 Del Mar.

Football NSW MiniRoos Schools Program
Based on the National MiniRoos Kick-Off program, the Football NSW MiniRoos Schools Program is a 6-week program that builds confidence through short game-based activities, delivered in an engaging and inclusive environment. Our MiniRoos Schools program focuses on participation with each player getting plenty of time on the ball to build fundamental motor skills, encouraging them to have fun, play for their school team or their local club and to show students that being active and healthy can be fun.
The MiniRoos Schools Program is a user pay program designed to run over a six-week block. Football NSW Development Officers will run the students through a series of planned activities designed to introduce and enhance their skills as well as improve coordination, fitness and enjoyment of the game of football, regardless of whether they play outside of school or not.

"What a scandal. Bloated material costs, bloated construction costs, dull designs, obstructive and inefficient consenting, obstructive financing, wrong-headed urban planning, neglected infrastructure, neglected trade training, fear of innovation, environmental idiocy – and we’ve been building the wrong houses: expensive houses, when we needed them good and cheap.
The government abandoned fit-for-purpose housing policies 35 years ago and the result has been social vandalism on a massive scale.
We built more homes per year in the 1970s. Not more per capita. More fullstop. If we’d kept up, especially with state houses, now called social housing, families today would routinely live in warm, dry homes. We would think of it, proudly, as a bedrock of citizenship and every other social measure would be vastly improved because of it.
Now, finally, there is change. Statistics NZ says more than 13,000 new homes were consented in Auckland last year, up 25 per cent up on the year before and four times as many as in 2009: a low point bequeathed to us by the last Labour Government.
The new Government is now building at “pace and scale”, as Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford likes to say.
But his mantra does not include innovation, quality, community-led or future-focused. Twyford does talk about these other values, but there’s a real risk “pace and scale” will drive them out.
The barriers to comprehensive change are immense.
It can easily cost a headache-inducing $5000sq m to build a house in Auckland. That will include an eye-bleeding amount for the land and compliance costs that will probably make you want to scream.
The problems are not being ignored. Many firms – architects, designers, builders, inventors, social innovators – are working on new design-and-build solutions. Council pre-consenting now allows developers to avoid some compliance demands if they can show their big project is just like another big project.
Good to know. But at the same time, the council is turning down inner-city projects for lack of carparking, even though the prospective residents don’t want to own a car.
Is it any wonder the Government’s new Housing and Urban Development Authority (HUDA) will take consenting for the big projects away from the council?
Still, more doesn’t mean better and we are not really talking transformation yet. Here’s my quick and dirty eight-point plan to kick that along.
1. Enable the not-for-profits.
Housing groups, iwi, urban Māori authorities, community services groups and others need better financing and more help with capacity and compliance issues. They are at the heart of the communities the Government wants to help.
John Tamihere at Te Whānau o Waipareira in Henderson has been saying it and so have many others. There’s some great work being done, but they’re desperate to do more.
2. Build more social houses.
The Government is committed to mixed development: if they remove 50 decrepit old state houses they might build 300 new homes, with 60 of them social housing, and you can’t always tell by looking.
That’s a good plan, because it minimises the risk that you’re building the slums of the future. But it slows down the provision of social housing where the need is greatest. Perhaps a higher proportion of social housing should be mandated.
3. Raise the enviro standards.
The Government was supposed to have the environmental shortcomings of the Building Code sorted by the end of the year, but it hasn’t happened. Tens of thousands of homes, including KiwiBuild homes, are not being built to the standards of energy efficiency and sustainability we all know will be needed in the years ahead.
A framework for fixing this – the Green Building Council’s Green Star system – is available. The delay is ridiculous. Please tell us we won’t have to wait another year while HUDA is set up.
4. Implement universal design.
This is the phrase for designs that cater for everyone, young and old, however able or disabled you are. Usually, it’s an add-on and it just adds costs. But if you address the issue from the start, with your basic design, the construction cost implications are low and the long-term savings are high.
Addressing those four issues well could disrupt the housing sector. But there’s more, and it’s much bigger.
5. Fabulous prefabs.
New construction technologies and materials are here now and more are on their way: prefab homes will profoundly change the way we build. But horror stories abound of the obfuscation and timidity shown by regulators who are not keeping up and often don’t seem to want to.
That’s one of the biggest jobs for HUDA, right there: changing the officials’ culture so we can have the construction revolution.
6. Small homes.
Same story: regulators have just not kept up. Did you know the easiest way to put a small house on a section is to put it on wheels? Technically, that makes it a housetruck. What nonsense.
7. The apartment block is a village.
Families, the elderly, single people, groups of friends, all living in the same building with health services, communal areas for recreation and maybe dining, maybe a school, definitely a garden on the roof.
It’s the village model, now being re-established at hapū level by some iwi, and it’s definitely relevant to the inner city.
8. More girls.
How transformative, for the better, for the whole of society, would it be to turn construction into an industry dominated by women? We could be starting that in schools right now.
By the way, Phil Twyford says his new HUDA needs a better name. True that. It’s going to oversee all of this and it should not become a bureaucratic megalith like some government departments we could all name.
HUDA has to provide the actively engaged framework within which communities can grow strong and proud. How about calling it Wharenui?

"Americans for Prosperity, the big-bucks boyos bankrolled by billionaires David and Charles Koch, is in for a dollar already this election cycle.
The independent expenditure group, which spent over $36 million on federal elections in 2012, has just launched a seven-figure ad campaign targeting three Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents.
Press release via Politico’s Playbook:
.”
Here’s the ad running in the Granite State:
Be honest, Scott Brown (R-Elsewhere): Are you loving this or what?
Also of note is this Politico piece about social conservatives “raising millions of dollars, coordinating their political spending and assiduously courting megadonors.”
Say it with us: Let the wild Whatever-Billion-Dollar rumpus begin!
If the poor truck could talk, it would say, “Dear god, no.”
The god part is good for New Hampshire, yeah?
________________________________________
Let’s hope the commonsense side of Granite State voters fuels a widespread repulsion at the thought of being bought out. We’re not for sale. That’s what makes our presidential primary so important. And Scott Brown remains not just a Massachusetts import, and thus suspect on many counts, but a failure as well.
He ain’t one of us, period.
Dicey policies and failed initiatives often mean that attention gets focused on those races where attention can make the difference. Money is part of the focus, and since it is the Koch’s to spend, who are we to say that we can’t
But, is the money that the Kochs are putting into the mix any different than the money that George Soros pumped into the 2008 election?
No? Didn’t think it was. And we didn’t here the the left complaining about the influx of cash into THEIR coffers to spend on THEIR causes.
But look at it this way. Soros made his money speculating on the downfalls of corporations and nations. The Kochs have made their money on exploring and developing sources of oil that eventually generates the electrons that allow us to have light and heat and electric vehicles and this very blog.
Neither is particularly noble, but at least one side is not making their money by betting on the misery of others.
George Soros largely sat out the 2012 elections, while the best estimates show that the Kochs spent an estimated $60 million, while Sheldon Adelson spent as much as $98 million.
Thank’s, Mikey, for the information…
But, since it is their money to do with what they will, what’s the difference between Soros’ money and the Kochs’ money, or Adlesons? Money in someone’s hands is money in someone’s hands. And as long as they follow the laws faithfully in its distribution, there should be no complaints.
Is the objection that they are “conservative” and Soros is not? Is the objection that they are giving more than the liberals can match?
And lets’ get back to where Soro’s GOT his money…betting on the failure of Greece and the US dollar. Is money gained by betting on others’ miserly lest tainted than that gained providing a commodity that people actual want and use?
If you’d like to discuss the re-institution of meaningful campaign finance reform and the reversal of the Citizens United decision — by all means, let’s do it. Agreed?
…or would campaign finance reform put too big a dent in “the nation’s largest grassroots champion for health care freedom”?
If you can find a loop-hole free way of implementing meaningful campaign finance reform, it’s not a bad idea.
Public financing might work, but, as always, the devil is in the details.
Now, as for Citizens United case, I would suggest reading the majority’s opinion and follow the legal trails that are revealed. The decision is based on at least a century of jurisprudence and, it has the effect if treating ALL equally, giving the corporation the same rights as the “union”, usually a corporation, too, in making its political voice heard.
You’ll argue that the minority opinion should be weighed. To which I will respond: Not only was it weighed but it was found lacking by the majority of the court. And since the majority of the court chose not to accept the dissenting views, from a legal standpoint, the dissent is irrelevant and the Citizens United decision is the law of the land and entitled to the deference of all lower courts and due deference by the Supreme court as a matter that has already been litigated.
“Unions!”
“Benghazi!”
Scott Brown is the definition of someone seduced by fame, without any qualifications to support it.
Sort-of like Barack Obama.

"What you should know before traveling abroad
WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE TRAVELING ABROAD
For most people, the opportunity to travel abroad is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Be it for a project, for business, or for leisure and vacation, traveling to a new country and immersing yourself in a new way of life can bring a lot of perspective. That being said, traveling abroad can be as much a nightmare as it can be a dream come true if you don’t have your process in place.
Traveling abroad is very exciting Here are some vital things to know before you embark on your out-of-country journey:
Knowledge is Power: It may sound boring and tedious but doing thorough research on your destination is one of the best and most rewarding things you can ever do. The reason is very obvious – while you know practically all there is to know about your home country, your knowledge on a foreign one is naturally next to none. Updating yourself on that allows you to know the essential things, which in turn helps you navigate your way when you reach there – both literally and figuratively.
Your Passport is Your Life: Without your passport, you will not even be allowed to go near an airplane. And without your passport in a foreign country, it will be very difficult for you to prove your identity, let alone citizenship. Always make sure that your passport is with you at all times and keep copies of it both at home (with someone you trust) and with you that you can easily use in case you happen to lose or misplace it.
If you don’t have insurance, you cannot afford to travel: Many consider insurance to be a fickle matter – the truth, however, couldn’t be farther than that. Health issues and calamities happen all the time, be it to you personally or in your destination at large. Having an insurance in place helps you be compensated for any troubles that you encounter that are beyond your control. In the event that you do have insurance, make sure it has all the adequate coverage.
Always Carry Prescriptions: Laws for medications vary from one country to another – for instance, a medicine that is available over-the-counter in your country, may not be available at all your destination country. Having a valid doctor’s prescription that lists all of your medications and vaccines makes the status of your medical needs, requirements and statuses legal. Additionally, it prevents you from running into any potential troubles that may arise due to differences in the availability of medicines.
Money Matters are Important: Apart from documents, money is the one pivoting aspect upon which the success (or failure) of your entire trip. As important it is to save on money, it is important to save the money you have from prying eyes and hands. Make sure you know about currency conversion rates, so that you can do your math and plan your expenditures accordingly. Next, make sure that your cards remain valid in the destination country – in the event that that is not the case, do get a card that does work. Try to make all your transactions in banks or ATMs instead of conversion centers, as they have a tendency to rip-off people in the name of conversion rates.",What are some important things to consider before traveling abroad?,"Before traveling abroad, it's important to thoroughly research your destination, always keep your passport with you and have copies of it, ensure you have adequate insurance, carry valid doctor’s prescriptions for your medications and vaccines, and understand the currency conversion rates and banking options in the destination country."

DINO OBERTO/For the Standard-Speaker Don Branson’s 1965 No. 4 Wynn’s Special, built by A.J. Watson, is one of a variety of restored Indy Cars that will be on display at Pocono Raceway this weekend.
During this weekend’s Pocono IndyCar 500 Fueled by Sunoco, past meets the present as an excellent array of vintage Indy Cars will be part of the festivities.
Last year a small group of restored and replica Indy Cars were on display along with several Midget and Sprint cars. It was a big hit among fans and even drew the attention of the contemporary drivers as well as former stars in attendance such as Rick Mears, Johnny Rutherford, Bobby Rahal and Mario Andretti. The cars even got track time.
“Last year we had an incredible influx of the classic drivers come over. And this year we are honoring Bob Harkey. Bob is the Grand Marshall of our event. When you celebrate the careers of these guys, we want to celebrate all the guys, not just the Unser’s and A.J. Foyt’s and Mario Andretti’s. We want to celebrate the little guys too,” said Gary Mondschein, event organizer.
“Here’s a guy that qualified for the 1964 Indy 500 in a Roadster and ran right from the Roasters and into the rear engine cars into ’80s. All these guys need to be recognized.”
Pocono Raceway COO Nick Igdalsky along with Roger Green gave Mondschein the green light last year to bring in the classic racers and looked forward to their return.
“Nick (Igdalsky) has been excessively responsive to me with this project and it’s been a pleasure to work with him. They were very happy to have us back. It was a big hit last year,” said Mondschein.
This year the entries have doubled to nearly 20. Cars from the 1930s to 1990s will be represented. An inkling of the list includes Joe Leonard’s STP Lotus wedge powered by a Pratt & Whitney turbine for legendary team owner Andy Granatelli. Don Branson’s 1965 No. 4 Wynn’s Special built by A.J. Watson and Jim Rathmann’s No. 16 Roadster Simoniz Special Watson-Offy in which Rathmann drove at Indy in 1959 and won the only Indy roadster race ever run at Daytona.
The cars will be on track twice Saturday and again Sunday before the start of the 500. In between track sessions they will be on display behind pit road.
Restoration of old Indy race cars has become big business. Each May during the Indy 500 a big event in presenting the vintage cars takes place.
“It’s actually turned into be a fairly good investment and the best indicator of how good an asset it is, recently a group of investment bankers got together and hired a guy to go out and buy specific cars, hold then and then resell them for profit. When you start to get groups of bankers together and they start buying old Indy Cars for profit, you know there’s money to be made there,” said Mondschein.
“The value of the cars is going up exponentially right now. It has to do with the pedigree of the car. If it finished in the top 10 at Indianapolis, the values are going up and up.”
Everything, whether it is an original car or a replica, is very precise and accurate right down to the smallest detail.
“Amazing amount to the details,” said Mondschein. “You have guys laying out the cars and snapping lines to get the exact details for the decals on where they were originally.”
In most cases finding original parts can be the biggest hurdle. A good search will eventually find you what you need, however for the newer cars, those from the seventies and eighties, there is reverse engineering done to produce the necessary pieces.
While the show of vintage race cars at Indinapolis is on a much broader scale, Mondschein wants his event to have a more personal feel to it.
“What we are trying to do here at Pocono is maintain a family atmosphere behind what we are doing. It’s not that we don’t want more cars, I’m not saying that at all. I want to maintain this as a family atmosphere. I would like people to come to this event and not have any pressure. We’re all buddies and friends and I would like to keep that with this group. These guys need to be treated with respect for what they’re doing. These cars are irreplaceable.”
Fans old and new can appreciate the vintage Indy Cars’ unique hand crafted bodies and the various sounds that will reverberate through the Pocono Mountains when their engines are fired up. They’ll also marvel at how far racing technology and safety have come.
What Mondschein and others like him have done is a true appreciation for the preservation of motor racing history.",Who is the Grand Marshall of the event mentioned in the context?,Bob Harkey.
"Welcome to Church ... Kids Not Invited
Mike Thomas
I was so distracted once at a church service (away from here), from an overwhelming amount of noise from the audience, that I had a hard time concentrating on the lesson. I tried focusing my attention on the speaker, but the person behind me and a few others across the isle were extremely loud—for what seemed to be every 30 seconds. The problem? You may think I am referring to rowdy kids or fussy children, with parents who would not take them out, but in fact I am referring to adults. The noise was coming from grown people during an adult Bible class! They had coughing attacks that made it difficult for them to sit quietly.
What did I do as a member of the audience? Instead of giving them the “evil eye” or condemning them, I extended patience to them with the hope they would quiet down in a little bit. And, after a few minutes, their coughing subsided. I may have missed a few comments the speaker was making, until the coughing stopped, but I eventually picked up on the lesson and was able to benefit from the study.
I recently learned of a church of Christ that does not permit small children in the auditorium during worship services. If the children want to accompany their parents to services, they must go to a daycare within the building during worship. While this might sound like a great solution to the “fuss” caused by small children, it reeks of foulness and self-centeredness to me. How can parents rear their children in the “training and admonition of the Lord” while leaving out one of the most essential aspects to godly living: worship? What kind of message does this send to the children regarding church services? To any honest observer it says, “If you bother me in church, I will have you removed.” There can be no other message sent!
How can the adults at that church teach the children about patience and longsuffering if they exclude children from worship for an occasional cry or whimper? I agree that excessively noisy kids should be removed—to a nursery or cry room to meet their needs. But that is a “horse of a different color” than not permitting them in worship services all together. If such is the case with children, what about adults who make excessive noise, as in coughing or sneezing too much? Are they to be denied entrance for not controlling their irritated throats and noses? To be consistent, such would have to be the case — for a coughing adult is no quieter than a toddler needing a diaper change!
If the reasoning behind keeping children out of worship is that it keeps things under control in the assembly, the people need to rethink their reasoning. They might think they are teaching the children the importance of worship by not permitting them to be in the assembly until they are quiet, but in reality it says the exact opposite. If worship is essential for Christian growth, which it is (I Corinthians 11:30; Hebrews 10:24-25), why are we not permitting them to witness and partake of it with us? How are we training them to worship God when we won’t even show them how to do it? Would we do the same with other “important” assemblies (funerals, weddings, etc.)? Even the Jews were taught to let their children see them worship so that “when your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?'“ they could then explain the need for worshipping God (Exodus 12:26-27). How can we do any less with a much greater covenant?
[If the matter is over “Children’s Church” in place of worship, then such would be just as wicked because godly “men” are to lead in worship (cf., I Timothy 2:8), and not children or women. Creating a separate assembly for children (or women) just for the sake of letting them have the lead in worship is just another way of resisting God’s will for women and children to be in submission to men.]
There must be a balance in the noise that takes place in the assembly. Those who are making the noise should do all they can to control it as soon as possible (I Corinthians 14:33). Those who are not making the noise must show patience and do their best to concentrate on God. The solution is not to ban small children from worship, else adults with health problems would need to be kicked out as well. Instead, our emphasis should be on the worship and praise of God, which is why we are assembled in the first place (Ephesians 5:19-20). God tells us He is a God who “is greater than our heart, and knows all things” (I John 3:20), so why should I be impatient with someone who needs 5 seconds to get their noise under control? If God can still hear our prayers, songs and praise, why should I stop offering it to Him because of a crying baby or coughing adult? Is it in keeping with God’s character to be impatient with others? Or is it in keeping with His attitude to be inconsiderate of others when we are making excessive noise? Then why should His worshippers fail to demonstrate such qualities in the most sacred assembly on earth — worship? How ironic it must be to God for people to gather in His name to worship Him (a selfless and considerate being) yet fail to extend the same attitude toward one another. Can people truly love God without showing such love to others (I John 4:20-21)?",What is the author's opinion on excluding children from worship services in church?,"The author disagrees with excluding children from worship services in church. He believes that it sends a wrong message to the children and hinders their learning about godly living and worship. He also argues that if children are excluded for making noise, then adults who make noise should also be excluded, which he finds inconsistent."
"Not unlike their drivers, Cobra has been confidently crafting some outstanding products in the fairway and hybrid lineups over the last couple release cycles. I remember back in the day with their LTD lineup, thinking it would be tough to top the idea of being able to audit the internals of a club, but as expected, they have taken steps forward to promote better and better, with a propensity for putting quality sound at the forefront of their deliverables.
What we have the opportunity to introduce to you today, is RADSPEED. Using the same radial weighting considerations that they have applied to their latest driver lineup, Cobra is strategically placing weight relative to the CG location to maximize performance between speed, control, and forgiveness. It sounds a bit loaded from the outside looking in, but golfers can actually see the weight configurations on each head in the lineup to understand where that weight is being featured, and with a bit of understanding on how weight placement works, recognize what Cobra is seeking to achieve.
It is probably worth considering how they got to this point, and much of that comes with better technology in weight saving techniques, like their thinply carbon crown, which is saving about six grams of weight from the crown. They also hollowed out their two rails that flow across the club head from face to back, once again finding ways to isolate that weight into better and more efficient locations. They have also found a significant improvement on the flexion properties by doing this, which means faster ball speeds for golfers.
While the rails have gotten hollow in the new design, the benefits remain the same. With a headshape like a fairway, we all as golfers need some quality turf interaction to promote a solid strike, and that has not changed for this release. Better flow through the grass means maximum ball speed, and that is something that I have loved about the Cobra fairway offerings over the last couple years. I personally have played the tour style head with complete confidence that I can get the head through the ball without battling the ground, and that is critical with a club at that distance.
One of the biggest stories out of Cobra recently was their infinity face, which has carried over into some of their fairway woods. For those seeking the benefits of the standard head or their draw head, the infinity face will be present to not only support serious consistency across the face, but act as a pretty fantastic safeguard against the dreaded pop fly skymark swing. When designing the latest version of the Big Tour and Tour heads, Cobra went with their regular CNC milling instead of the infinity CNC at the preference of their Tour staff.
The colors for RADSPEED are nothing short of spectacular. Transitioning slightly from their previous yellow, the new offering features “Turbo Yellow” and white accents off a matte black face for the regular and draw versions, with a slight tweak in the tour offerings having a gloss finish on the crown. For the regular RADSPEED head, Cobra has also introduced their ever (Puma) popular “Peacoat Blue” with white, red, and black accents that immediately caught my eye. I love that they took an incredibly popular blue and made it reality, making golfers almost feel like they have a limited edition driver in their bag after the last few US Open limited runs.
For RADSPEED Hybrids, Cobra has maintained that radial weighting perspective with one adjustable weight in the back, and two weights at the front of the head near the toe and the heel. Looking at the internals of the head, you can see just how much of the weight is present on the extremes to promote lower CG and spin, which in turn leads to faster ball speed (read: distance). They have a high strength forged face insert that has variable face thickness to maintain consistency, and are carrying over the hollow split rails to save on weight and isolate it to other regions. While Radial weighting is the big story for 2021, I still firmly believe that the rail system is critical for success in a head of this design. Promoting quality turf Cinteraction in a hybrid is paramount, and if history is any indicator of the performance aspects of Cobra’s design, this offering will not fall short on allowing golfers to swing with confidence from a variety of different lies.
As you would expect, they are offering their one length option in blue/white/red accents as we have seen in the past for that style of product (in 19, 21, and 24 degrees), and continuing their turbo yellow and white accents on the standard model (17, 19, 21, and 24 degrees). From a top line perspective, only subtle differences are openly present, which reflects the colorway for each head.
From driver to hybrid, Cobra has taken weight placement to the next level, focusing on what each individual golfer needs with a product that suits their game. With colorways that look absolutely spectacular in pictures, it is hard to fathom golfers will not fall in love with the presentation as soon as the product is in hand.

While Fisk University was fighting a drawn-out legal battle over the fate of a high-profile art collection, it quietly sold two other paintings in the school’s archives. That twist in the story was first reported Tuesday in the New York Times.
Former Fisk president Hazel O’Leary spent nearly a decade battling the courts, art lovers and alumni over whether a university that was deeply in debt could raise money by selling off two paintings donated by Georgia O’Keeffe as part of the Alfred Stieglitz collection. Ultimately, the Tennessee attorney general stepped in to block the sale.
But in 2010, the school sold two other paintings: one by Florine Stettheimer, the other by Rockwell Kent. The final decision was made by O’Leary and Fisk’s board of trustees “with the best interest of Fisk University in mind,” according to a statement from the university.
Ken West, a former Fisk spokesman who worked closely with O’Leary, says he doesn’t believe it was intentionally kept quiet.
“It might be new to some, but it’s definitely not new, and I don’t think it’s earth-shattering if you consider the financial condition the university was in at the time,” he says.
Universities often come under fire by the art world for selling high-dollar possessions when they’re in financial trouble. West says that point of view lacks context.
“It’s one thing to say, ‘Don’t sell the painting because it has a rich tradition and it’s very important’ — and that’s very true,” he says. “But I want the same people who are critical to tell these first-generation students that they can’t come back next year because there are no funds to provide them a scholarship.”
West calls the decision to sell these paintings a “last resort.”
Fisk University wouldn’t disclose the amount of money it received for the paintings. The art dealer who facilitated the sale, Patrick Albano of Aaron Galleries in Illinois, tells WPLN that the two pieces sold for more than half a million dollars each.
As for the art donated by Georgia O’Keefe, even though Fisk couldn’t sell it, the school ended up making a deal to split the ownership of the Alfred Stieglitz collection with a museum in Arkansas for $30 million.
In a written statement, interim president Frank Sims says the university has “thrived in a number of ways” since then. After being put on probation by its accrediting body, Fisk was put back on solid footing in late 2013.
“This year marks the 150th anniversary of Fisk University,” Sims writes. “We have celebrated our many accomplishments, including the re-opening of the Carl Van Vechten Gallery, the return of the Alfred Stieglitz Collection of Modern Art, an increase in university enrollment, and the addition of a Fulbright scholar to the Fisk faculty, among other accomplishments.”
This story was originally published on July 27, 2016.",What was the controversy surrounding Fisk University's art collection?,"The controversy was about whether Fisk University, which was deeply in debt, could raise money by selling off two paintings donated by Georgia O’Keeffe as part of the Alfred Stieglitz collection.

Until Henderson proves this year's 3P% isn't a fluke, I don't want him.
The part of getting the 'other guy' in the backcourt with Rose, I'm gonna leave up to the Bulls FO to figure that out, idk everyone's contract situations nor do I have the time to think about it and look it up and keep up to date with all that tbh I'll admit, got other things going on much more important. I threw a few names out there that I think you took literally. But I'm not saying I wouldn't like the idea of them being on the Bulls but we'll see how things play out.
Gordon was considered a very very good player who can be an all star and was spoken highly of the first few years, only knock was injuries so hence he got a max or near max offer.
Batum also is another guy who is highly regarded around the league for his career so hence he got a good offer for himself.
Stuckey was one of the main guys that Detroit wanted to keep and thus it showed by them ridding of Billups essentially. He was going to be part of their core.
Evans as of right now, the same can't be said for I think.
But just want to remind everyone, I'm just putting a name out there (even tho I wouldn't mind Evans personally).

Aubryn perplexes: who owns Hope’s successes?
She ignited a spark, but who fanned it, she guesses:
Did Hope hide a power, deep down lying waiting,
Or has someone intruded, new power creating?
‘This will not do!
She’s been born anew;
My blood link to leech
And the dark that I teach
Have been all but dissolved,
Her will has evolved.
She’s stolen their souls,
Broken free my control.’
‘I have returned!
Your plan has been burned.
You thought me weak,
That my chances were bleak;
But I alter fate
To dampen your hate;
The strings that you tied her
Now reside inside her.’

Relishing readily with his magic contradictory
To the powers of destruction and darkness and ice;

‘CURSE YOU, MAN,
You’ve done all you can
To cage me in chains
But your efforts in vain;
I will cast off this curse,
Till you’ve felt my worst;
I will break you apart
With just one magic dart.’
‘No! You must not!
Mind me in your thoughts;
Remember our love,

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Think about it: if you don’t know what people are saying about you, then how can you possibly address the issues you face? Quite simply, you can’t, which is where a customer satisfaction survey comes in. Not only can it tell you whether or not your perfect customers are pleased with you, it can help you learn where to improve. In fact, a well-crafted customer service satisfaction survey practically does the work for you. Goodbye, costly consulting. Hello, satisfied customers and increased profits.
Well, you might be thinking, of course, it would be nice to have all that information, but how exactly do customer service surveys work? That’s a great question. Believe it or not, a satisfaction survey is much simpler than you might think. It requires little more than targeting some questions that are essential to your company’s performance (more on that later), putting them together in a way that makes sense (such as the template we offer in the download above), and making sure you survey frequently enough to get useful results.
Keep in mind that a customer satisfaction questionnaire can take many forms, such as a customer service survey or a guest satisfaction survey, so be sure to try different forms before you finalize your survey that you use over time.
Customer Satisfaction Survey Questions
To benefit from your survey, you need the right customer satisfaction survey questions. If you sell computers, for instance, it won’t help you much to ask your customers “Why do you like computers?” You know why, or can at least guess. Slightly modifying your survey questions so they are specific to your business, however, is very useful: “Why do you like our products?” can tell you a lot about what you’re doing right … or wrong, depending on the answer you get.
Good customer service survey questions target a range of subjects, including:
- What customers consider a good or bad experience
- What motivates them to purchase
- What turns them off
- What provides incentive to keep buying from or working with you
In order to provide the most insight, your client satisfaction survey questions should target all of these, either in every survey, or in various surveys that you send at different times.
Asking the right types of retail customer service survey questions, including multiple choice for quantitative data and open-ended for qualitative information, can help you cover the gamut of necessary information. Use customer service satisfaction survey questions to find out about the needs, the desires, and the psychology of your shoppers. Still need examples or assistance? Check out the customer satisfaction survey sample questions above!
Customer Satisfaction Survey Template
Whether you craft it on your own or borrow a professional template, such as the one we offer above, using a customer satisfaction survey template will save you time, money, and emotional energy. Let’s consider how a customer service survey template can help you avoid wasting any of these resources.
First, time. You don’t need us to tell you that working with a sample customer satisfaction survey is bound to make your life easier than creating one from scratch. With meaty customer satisfaction survey examples at your fingertips, you can avoid struggling to come up with the right types of questions on your own, wondering if you’re “doing it right,” conducting a lot of pointless Google searches, and generally fence-sitting when you could be spending your time more productively. A picture is worth a thousand words, but an example might be worth even more.
Second, customer survey examples save you money. On the one hand, when managers are freed from the time-consuming task of creating questions they could find in a template, they can turn their attention to other tasks. On the other, you avoid the possibility of sending out a disorganized or low-quality survey that might not get the results you need.
And last but not least, heartache. Nothing burns like spending a bunch of time carefully putting a survey together, only to discover that it doesn’t actually target your needs. By using a sample customer service survey, on the other hand, you’ll get the information you need right away with only a little tweaking. Plus, solid customer service survey examples can help you forge a consistent template of your own, which will help you compare apples to apples data on all customers, and that you can use again and again.
Customer Satisfaction Survey Best Practices
Although most surveys are bound to generate at least some useful information, by using survey design best practices, you can ensure you’re utilizing the best ways to measure customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction survey best practices cover a range of habits, among them, surveying routinely, tying survey results to revenue, and using different question types to elicit different kinds of information.
As we discussed above, for instance, you should split your questions between open-ended and multiple choice. The former really lets the customer express their opinion, potentially offering valuable insight you wouldn’t have received with a multiple choice question set. Those multiple choice questions, on the other hand, are easy to quantify and can give you a big-picture look at what your customers as a whole think of you, which would be harder to get simply from open-ended queries.
Don’t forget that different departments provide “customer service” to each other. Sending out a periodic internal customer satisfaction survey can help you figure out how to help teams work together more efficiently and communicate better, which benefits the company as a whole. Internal customer service survey questions may also help you identify shining stars among your teams, after which you can ask them how they work and apply their strategies to the rest of your company.
Remember that customer satisfaction surveys, both internal and external, exist only to help you succeed as a company. As such, it is in your best interest to perform them regularly, efficiently and dedicatedly. The template above can help get you started.
Customer Satisfaction Survey Form
In ye olden days, putting out a survey required a costly outlay of paper, stamps, and manpower (anyone remember stuffing envelopes till their fingers bled? No, us neither … ) Today, though, it’s much easier to craft a great customer satisfaction survey form on the fly. By using modern survey and form software providers, such as Survey Monkey, Formstack or Gravity Forms, you can get your questions to your customers quickly, easily and without a huge payout. Plus, your answers roll in faster and collate automatically, reducing the workload required to make sense of all that data. What’s not to like?",What are some of the benefits of using a customer satisfaction survey template?,"Using a customer satisfaction survey template can save time, money, and emotional energy.

"Belly Exposed
Alexa is showing a lot, but she really hasn’t gained much weight. In fact, doc says she will lose weight, as much as 20 pounds, as a result of this pregnancy. In contrast, I have swelled to an all time high.
Children are so frank and wonderful aren’t they? Or are they just evil?!! Here’s why I ask.
A little boy in church innocently asked Alexa what she had in her round belly. In response, she said, “a baby!”
The little boy giggled.
His mom chuckled.
Alexa and I laughed.
Ahhhhhh……what a cute little boy! All is well with the world.
Then, in just a matter of seconds, the little boy’s smile turns slightly downward. Like the wind and to my horror he turned towards my direction. He gazed at my eyes. As soon as I realized that Alexa’s belly was no longer the focus of his attention, I became stuck. I couldn’t move as if in a trance. I read his eyes very clearly. At that point in time, I knew where the rest of the conversation was heading. I felt defenseless and my belly was suddenly exposed to the world. Need I say more?

Please Don't Call Me Mr. Mom!
I am very excited about being the primary caregiver to my son, Gideon. I've yet to figure out how I am going to get any work done, being that most of my time will be spent changing diapers, feeding, then changing diapers again. I'll figure it out.
If you didn't know already, I work from home doing a variety of things like marketing communications, freelance writing, and technical stuff.
Alexa seems to have trouble understanding what it is I do. Ever since she's known me, I've never settled to hold on to just one job at any single moment. Right now, I got about ""fi job,"" with the potential of few more to come. Any of you old enough to remember the television program, ""In Living Color,"" knows what I'm referring to.
Plus, Alexa has a tendency of getting sleepy when I start talking about the technical aspects of my job. I don't blame her. In an effort to keep you, the reader, awake, I won't divulge information as to what I do for a living.
Anyway, did you know that stay-at-home-daddyship is all the rage these days due to the number of men who are taking on this role? Here are some stats. The November, 2004 U.S. Census Bureau reports that in 2003 the number of stay-at-home fathers was 98,000. The following year, this number has risen significantly – in 2004, there were 143,000.
As time goes on, I will take pictures of my adventures as a stay-at-home dad and keep you updated. In the meantime, rest assured that I have been practicing using my ""Baby Bjorn"" with ""Bunny."" I'm hesitant to display pics of me with the Baby Bjorn on, but I have uploaded a picture of Bunny with his pal Miggy for your slight amusement. Talk to you soon.

Our Babymoon...sort of.
Have you all heard of the term babymoon? It is supposed to be a couple's last vacation before the baby comes. A time to be alone together, a romantic time, a time to reflect on the changes that are about to take place in your lives. Alex and I of course refuse to be slaves to tradition! Romantic moments? Hah! Time to reflect and be alone? Hah hah! What could be more perfect than to join my crazy family on a 6 hour car trip to Maine for Labor Day weekend? Let's all pile into the mini-van with luggage, an 8 month pregnant woman, her 5 foot long pregnancy pillow, and the singing Morales clan! Yes, we sing.
We had a great time. Despite my mother (that is her before breakfast), the fact that Alex and I both threw up on the lighthouse tour boat, that it was way too cold to go swimming, that since I got sick on the boat my stomach was too queasy to eat a lobster roll, we had a great time. We all got a chance to reconnect and to be a family again. I haven't gone on a family vacation since I got married, and I didn't realize how much I had missed it. It's fun to be part of a kooky family. There are memories that become really funny stories.
Greetings from Pregnancy Land! Alex and I have decided to start this blog, so that we can keep our family and friends updated on the final stages of my pregnancy and beyond. We can also post pictures, so that you can all see what's going on. Some of you have begged to see pictures of me ""preggers"", so I will definitely post some of those. ( I am actually 5 months pregnant in the above photo) I am now 35 weeks pregnant, which means that I only have 4-5 weeks to go! I am definitely waddling. I have discovered the reason why pregnant women waddle; because it hurts not to. I can no longer walk like a normal human being. If I do my pelvic bones scream in pain and agony. Hey, aren't you glad you know that about me now?.",Who is the primary caregiver to Gideon?,The primary caregiver to Gideon is his father.

The survey found that 80% of sales agents and associate brokers rated the value of technology supplied by their broker as being extremely valuable or somewhat valuable, and 65% responded yes when asked if they wanted their broker to expand the amount of technology offered. Sixty-four percent also said they communicate with past clients quarterly or more often.

"The tragic shootings at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek this past Sunday are the latest murders in a long series of violent acts that have occurred with disturbing frequency in recent years. Our hearts, prayers and sympathies go out to the Sikh community, the victims and their families. All of Milwaukee stands in solidarity with those who are so terribly affected by this tragedy.
In my prayers and reflections since Sunday morning, I have been struck by the seemingly increasing struggle between the culture of life and the forces of death. While social critics, psychologists and ordinary folks will debate the root cause of such terrible acts of violence, we would all agree that, in many ways, our society has become increasingly coarsened and insensitive to human dignity and the right to life.
Children experience a bombardment of violence from a very early age; what popular movie or video game does not portray multiple and grisly destruction of human life? How many children grow up in neighborhoods of random shootings, drug deals and burglaries? I watched with deep sadness the video of schoolchildren verbally abusing an older woman who was serving as a chaperone on a field trip.
In many ways, our American society has become increasingly secular, pushing the influence of religion out of the public square. This rejection of the spiritual dimension of the human community is a tremendous loss because all authentic religion is a vital force for peace, justice and concern for the marginalized. When we fail to see the grand transcendence and absolute dignity of the human person, violence, disrespect and injustice will assuredly increase. Apart from its theological dimensions, religion is a vital force for social good.
The Catholic Church embraces a remarkably consistent life ethic, condemning both abortion and capital punishment, carefully laying out the criteria for a war to be considered just, proclaiming the peace and reconciliation won for us through the cross and resurrection of Christ. Yet many people in our society see the aforementioned forms of violence as not only acceptable, but as beneficial. As long as the death of another person, whether it is a child in the womb, a prisoner on death row or an “enemy” of some sort is seen as a good thing, we are still shackled by the chains of the culture of death.
Hollywood will continue to churn out films of graphic violence and pornographic sexuality as long as they are financially lucrative. Legislators and presidents will continue to protect state-sanctioned abortion as long as they perceive it to be in their political self-interest. Inner city neighborhoods will continue to be wracked by murders and drugs as long as everyone thinks “that is not my problem.”
In other words, the culture of death will continue to flourish as long as we collectively allow it to by remaining indifferent, by feeding it our entertainment dollars, by accepting violence as normal, by not articulating and proclaiming the Gospel of Life. Peace, respect, reconciliation and justice are hard work and can only be sustained by a proper understanding of the human person as worthy of absolute respect, as the proper end of all human activity. All violence, scape-goating and victimization end in the cross of Jesus Christ. By surrendering himself to death, the Son of God subverts all forms of human manipulation, the using of another for one’s own selfish gain. Where the culture of death takes the life of another for some perceived gain, Jesus offers his life, so that we can all gain together the saving love of God and the reconciliation of a world redeemed.
The Gospel of Life offers us a breath-taking vision of human flourishing, solidly rooted in the proper understanding of the person, created in the image and likeness of God, redeemed by the Son and sanctified in the Holy Spirit. We pray for the many victims of violence and we commit ourselves to the culture of life.",What does the Catholic Church's life ethic condemn according to the context?,The Catholic Church's life ethic condemns both abortion and capital punishment.

"There are many factors that you may like to get a GPS UNIT dog system. You may be looking for the perfect pet or even an extra set of hands when you have a small dog that needs interest. There are so many methods to watch your pet. In fact , it’s the just way to essentially be able to find out everything that happens when you have your animal with you.
Regardless of what you’re looking for, the one thing is certain that is certainly that the Internet is filled with thousands of resources. You just have to choose one is the very best for you. The first thing that you need to do is select a site that allows you to either pick the unit or you can rent it for a time period.
Once you have made the decision which option you want to select, you’ll be able to get the information about the dog keeping track of device. It is vital to note that some sites provide free sections that require fees to be paid out. The fee would usually be a one-time charge and you simply would only need to make a one-time payment for the use of these devices.
If you’ve at any time owned a puppy then you are aware that they are very happy to take walks in the park or around the neighborhood. Even though they could be kind of one or two, they are also extremely loyal and willing to give you love and devotion. All you have to perform is to have patience to train them and let them do their business.
Some people just who are searching for these puppies simillar to them as they are great companion animals. They are really very wonderful in searching for different dogs and can almost always can be found. They can learn to hunt, operate and perform just like a puppy.
It is very hard to teach a dog to not run and play around people. This is a good thing because you will possibly not always be throughout the house to see the actual dog has been doing. When you have your dog that enjoys people, you already know they’ll remain glad to please you when you usually are there.
Usually do not ignore the puppies. In fact , most of the people do. If they find a community dog master or a pet shop to take them to, they usually admit they abhor the animals. You should think it over.",What are some reasons one might want a GPS UNIT dog system?,"Some reasons one might want a GPS UNIT dog system include looking for the perfect pet, needing an extra set of hands for a small dog that requires attention, and wanting to monitor their pet's activities."
"This next part of Carpenter’s story brings up an important issue. Indenture amounted to legal slavery, but it appears that even some Natives pursued this option over being imprisoned on a reservation. Reservations were notoriously dangerous places, where Natives were dependent on incompetent and downright abusive Indian agents for food, shelter and protection. Ironically, they also became collecting spots for Indian traders. The concentration of Natives on a reservation made it easier for men to gather children and young squaws without the trouble of hunting them down. Natives who attempted to leave the “protection” of the reservation were sometimes shot, even if they were starving and in search of food.
I believe there were quite a few settlers that offered asylum to the Natives through indenture. It was a scary time to be Indian, and for some, falling under white protection, even if as a slave, may have been their only hope.
Continued from 8/31/09 post
… About this time the Department of Indian Affairs ordered all Indians living in their tribal relations to the reservation. Many of them had been there, and not liking the treatment they received, preferred rations of acorns a part of the time and starvation afterwards to going under Uncle Sam’s protection.
An attempt was made to force them to the reservation, but they fled to the hills and did not return until the officers were at a safe distance. The local story runs that then a learned judge of Cal- pella in his blandest tones tried persuasion. ” Now, boys,” he said, addressing them, ” I have been here among you a long time, and you all know I am ami- cus humani generis, or I wouldn’t be talking to you today; and I am thoroughly convinced that it would be to the interest of every one of you to go sine. mom. Of course you would be kept sumptibus publicis, and if everything didn’t go adgustus, it certainly is the great desideratum. We do not intend to force you to go nolens volens, but as I have tried to make you understand, it most assuredly is commune boiium.”
O, why did n’t he say ” nix cum rouse,” and give them a certain time in which to guess the puzzle ! [Lynette’s note… this is completely lost on me… anyone that can explain this is encouraged to try]
Before the second appearance of the officers, determined to enforce the governmental order, many of the Indians took advantage of the State law, and obtained guardians,— whole families being bound to one person. The rest again sought shelter in the mountains. Conspicuous among the latter were Captain John and family.
In Little Lake Valley some persons were bitterly opposed to Indians, and aided the officers in getting them to the reservation. A little later some of the exiles returned to their homes and were shot down like wild animals. Two old blind squaws escaped in the brush and were soon several miles from their murdered companions; but it was not long before hunger overcame their discretion, and their piteous howls attracted the attention of some hunters, who kindly took them to a neighboring valley. From that day to this, Little Lake Valley has had no resident Indians.
The Indians were quiet and well-behaved, and made their guardians no trouble ; but to the shame of some of the guardians, the same cannot be said of them. In many cases a great mistake was made as to the party that needed restraint. A few of the Indians were allowed to remain in the rancheria, were paid for all labor as before, and kindly treated, but the majority were forced to come and live on the ranch and work without remuneration. Some complained that they did not even have enough to eat. Some guardians were so exacting that if an Indian was wanted for work he must come, unless his excuse was as good as that once given for a witness who did not appear in court. There were nine reasons why the witness was absent. ” State them,” said the Judge. ” In the first place he is dead.” Just so with the Indian who would remain at home in harvest time; to do so with impunity he must be dead. Once an Indian who refused to work had his hands tied behind him with one end of a lariat, the other being securely fastened to the horn of the rancher’s saddle; thus the trio started for the harvest field. The horse bucked his rider off, and dragged the Indian some distance. When he was picked up, both arms were dislocated at the shoulder, having been turned from back to front. This of course was an extreme case, and did not meet with general approval. A more common method of correction, as an Indian expressed it, was to be ” whipped with a picket fence.”
Many times, under the cover of night, the rancheria has been surrounded by human monsters, armed with knives and pistols. The poor creatures, afraid of their very lives, have many, many times left their beds and fled for protection to a neighboring farmhouse. If an Indian dared attempt a defense of his wife or sister, he was fortunate indeed if he escaped a shot or stab, in connection with a sound beating.
The kind farmer who gave the Indians permission to come and sleep in his barn at such times was a good Samaritan on many occasions, and is still able to laugh over his great surgical feat of putting in place Sam’s protruding liver, and stitching a knife wound of several inches in length, which was inflicted by a boy still in his teens.
Once, a boy on his way home from school threw a stone at some majellas. and killed a baby that hung in a basket on the mother’s back. It was the expressed opinion that he was a bad boy. but no complaint was made ; probably his parents never even heard of the circumstance.
To be continued …
More happy stuff, I know, but I think the perspective of a first hand witness is invaluable to the study of this time period.
sigh
There isn’t much to say to this, is there?
no, there isn’t. Where do we find a way to see our own horrors as clearly as we can see those of the past? Reading this it seems so obvious that the “good” people should have fought to protect the Indians. What will our descendants think we should have seen?
Oh geez… that is such a frightening thought.
Though I think if we are objective… there are so many human rights violations and cruelties happening every day (I don’t know if you saw my post about what is happening in the Congo
But I think we do know what is wrong, and what we tolerate anyway… this is such a big topic…
It brings up the question of what we should do, and what we can do, realistically…
Which is probably EXACTLY the questions folks here faced back then",What were the conditions like for Natives living on reservations according to Carpenter's story?,"According to Carpenter's story, reservations were notoriously dangerous places for Natives. They were dependent on incompetent and abusive Indian agents for food, shelter, and protection. Natives who attempted to leave the reservations were sometimes shot, even if they were starving and in search of food. The concentration of Natives on a reservation made it easier for men to gather children and young women without the trouble of hunting them down."

"Defining resources within Kubernetes manifests
Within a given pod, a resource request and limit can be set for every container. These values are helpful for the application's health, as you have guaranteed capacity. It can also benefit the compute through scheduling and provisioning suitable capacity in the kernel by the kubelet.
Requests
The Kubernetes scheduler ensures that
for each resource type, the sum of the resource requests of the scheduled Containers is less than the node's capacity. By not specifying requests, the scheduler will apply the BestEffort class to your pod. This class means there is no guarantee for scheduling, and because this is the least priority, there is high potential for the pod's eviction.
Limits
Containers that don't specify resources will inherit the host's capacity for their lifecycle. When limits are not defined, you could start to see your container's CPU throttled or OOMKills with memory. If multiple containers are defined, and both try to share compute vs. defining what it needs explicitly, you could see uncontrollable saturation on your node.
To visualize the effects of limits first lets describe a node:
~ kubectl get node test-node -o jsonpath='{.status.capacity.memory}{""\n""}' 7887008Ki
Then create a pod without specifying resources limits:
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: no-resources spec: containers: - args: - /usr/bin/bash image: ubuntu imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent name: shell resources: {} tty: true nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/hostname: test-node EOF
By examining the cgroup memory limit, we see that the container capacity limits are nearly identical in value to the underlying node:
LIMIT=$(kubectl exec -it no-resources -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes) echo ""scale=0; ${LIMIT}/1024/1024"" | bc -l 8796093022207
Alternatively, when you set the values, we should see our defined capacity.
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: resources spec: containers: - args: - /usr/bin/bash image: ubuntu imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent name: shell resources: limits: memory: 200Mi tty: true nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/hostname: test-node EOF LIMIT=$(kubectl exec -it resources -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes) echo ""scale=2; ${LIMIT}/1024/1024"" | bc -l 200.00",What happens when resource limits are not defined in Kubernetes containers?,"Containers that don't specify resources will inherit the host's capacity for their lifecycle. When limits are not defined, you could start to see your container's CPU throttled or OOMKills with memory. If multiple containers are defined, and both try to share compute vs. defining what it needs explicitly, you could see uncontrollable saturation on your node."

Wild Tales Abound at Tropic Cinema
Reviewed by Shirrel Rhoades
Film Critic, Cooke Communications
Six films offer up some wild tales this week at the Tropic Cinema.
In fact, one is called ""Wild Tales."" This Argentinian-Spanish anthology of short vignettes gives us stories both ironic and bleak … but fascinating. You’ll encounter revenge on an airplane, road rage, a demolition man versus a tow truck, battling newlyweds, and more. TV Guide says, ""Very few films have been as appropriately titled as writer/director Damian Szifron's omnibus black comedy."" An the Observer calls it ""a splendidly anarchic portrait of a world on the verge of a nervous breakdown.""
Another wild premise is found in ""Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter,"" the story of a Japanese woman who travels to America in search of the hidden money in the movie ""Fargo.""
What if we all assumed that movies were real? Minneapolis Star Tribune describes it as ""a supple combination of Little Red Riding Hood adventure, ironic road film and cross-cultural confusion,"" while Examiner opines, ""Fans of obscure cinema will fall in love with this beautiful, cryptic, and outstanding treasure hunting pilgrimage.""
""It Follows"" is a wild horror flick, a new twist on unseen ghosties and ghoulies. Here they are transmitted by sex. Just like in the old slasher films, sex can be a death warrant! ReelViews notes, ""Good horror films rely on suspense and tension, and this one has both elements aplenty."" And Globe and Mail calls it ""less a conventional scary horror film than a fitful, disturbing dream.""
""Focus"" is the story of a con man, a wild puzzler filled with plot twist that keep you surprised. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are the romantic swindlers in this fun ride. Seattle Weekly observes that the movie would ""like nothing more than to evoke the easy style and playful personality of the Oceans movies."" And Antagony & Ecstasy find that it ""soars just enough to be, on balance, an enjoyable bit of fluff.""
Offering a calmer setting (but rippling with wild emotions) we have ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" the sequel about a gaggle of Brits who retire to a rundown hotel in India. Salt Lake Tribune says, ""Mostly it's a chance to hear some saucy senior citizens trade barbs, with the delightful dames, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, making the most of it."" And The Atlantic decides, ""Sometimes second best is good enough.""
And not to be ignored is a documentary from actor Ethan Hawke, ""Seymour: An Introduction."" Here we meet Seymour Bernstein, a beloved pianist and teacher, who
shares a poignant guide to life. Washington Post calls it ""a soaring, sublime and enduringly meaningful glimpse of a man who is undoubtedly the real thing."" And Philadelphia Inquirer tells us, ""One needn't be a music aficionado, or a musician, to appreciate the modest erudition coming from this man.""
Wild tales … good times … at the Tropic.

"Tummy time is recommended from birth to strengthen baby's arms, back and neck muscles and prevent the back of his head becoming flat. Jay L. Hoecker, M.D, of the Mayo Clinic, says babies should not sleep or be left unattended on tummies, but the position will help move them toward milestones of rolling and crawling. If your baby does not like lying on his tummy, there are ways you can help him learn to enjoy it.
Comfort
Make sure baby is nice and comfortable by using a soft surface like a bed and a fleecy blanket. Your baby may feel more comfortable on his tummy if you take his clothes and diaper off, making sure the room is nice and warm. This way he will not have anything pressing into his tummy and the feeling of being naked may add to his enjoyment. It is best not to make tummy time straight after a feed as his full tummy may not feel comfortable. Try to position his arms in front of him as he can eventually start to use them to lean on. Don't make tummy time too long to begin with; HealthyChildren.org advises that a newborn only needs three to five minutes two or three times a day, which can gradually be increased.
Touching
Your baby may enjoy the sensation of your fingers running gently down her back while she lies on her tummy -- this works better on bare skin. You can also stroke her cheeks, tickle her toes and gently massage her hands, feet and legs. If she is feeling a bit uncomfortable or unsure, this touching may help to put her at ease. Massage will also relax her muscles, helping her whole body feel more comfortable.
Stimulation
Keep your baby stimulated with lots of visual aids. Dr. Sears says young babies like to look at bright colors, stripes and black and white objects, so place some of these around your baby to catch his attention. Wave noisy toys, such as rattles or scrunchy toys for him to look at, or wiggle your fingers in front of him. You could also play some music during tummy time, as this sound stimulation may be another way of distracting him from any anxiety about this new position.
Interaction
Your baby loves listening to your voice, so try reclining beside her and singing or talking. You could also place her on a bed and sit on the floor so your face is level with hers. Tummy time can also work if you lie on your back with baby on her tummy on your tummy. You make a warm and soft surface, and she will love being that close to you and looking into your face. Another way of introducing tummy time is by laying her across your lap on her front.

"killing the grass for replanting
leripatFebruary 25, 2007
Hi all -
I'm trying to kill off large parts of my backyard lawn to replant with low-water-use shrubs. What's the best/easiest way to do this? I've used Roundup, and that has worked ... sort of. Is it safe to dig the remaining dead grass into the soil and then plant? And why in the world do sod growers use that blasted indestructible, non-biodegradable, infuriating green netting? Do they think no one is ever going to want to dig up the sod someday? (Can you tell I've been dealing with it today?)
Thanks in advance ...
I too am looking to do this in my backyard. We moved into the new house last fall and the home builder installed the sod that is now well established. Unfortunately our ground is clay and insanely heavy so if you just go and dig the stuff out it's really unpleasant. I was thinking of placing plastic sheets on it and weighing them down and waiting for it to die. I have dogs that run out back so I don't really want to poison it. I am worried though that this bermuda is more resilient than I think and that the plastic sheeting won't do anything to it. Any ideas?
I'm in costal So Cal and have been asking similar questions.
Below is a paraphrasing of the responses to my questions and other bits I've found on the forums (none of it is my direct experience... yet!)
The black sheets will work, but it takes about a year. And it seems that the whole area needs to be covered, not just a portion (another person was asking about raised beds, and was told that wouldn't work).
Round up works as long as the grass is growing, and needs to be used several times. Since you want the grass growing, it's important to keep watering and then use round up several times.
I am very interested in how successful you are in killing it and then planting shrubs and the like.
I found this on the turffalo.com website. Hopefully it will help, but you'll have to wait until the bermuda starts growing, which it probably is by now., weÂve.
Hope this help.

How does vinegar work? What does it kill,and does it leave any residual that will interfere with replanting?
I tried the laying down newspaper and piling dirt and mulch for a raised flower bed (the lasagna method?) and it worked great!
I xeroscaped my back yard with one good coat of round up (I did mix it double strength). Waited for it to turn brown and topped it with mulch. It's never come back. I use fresh dirt to plant my new gardens in, each plant gets new dirt. I do have to spray on occassion because of weeds popping through.
Like the others have said, it's hard to beat Roundup. I install landscapes for a living, so i've done this many times. I have seen some other landscapes that have not been sprayed(just hand weeded) and they always seem to have problems with weeds.
I personally use Roundup QuikPro. It contains Glyphosate(systemic), Diquat(kills plants at foliage), and it also has a surfactant.
If you do have Bermuda grass, make sure you have completely killed it before you plant in the area. You will regret it in the future because Bermuda sure is a pain in planting beds.",What are some methods mentioned for killing off large parts of a lawn for replanting?,"Some methods mentioned include using Roundup, covering the area with black sheets for about a year, and laying down newspaper and piling dirt and mulch on top. It's also suggested to keep watering the grass and use Roundup several times. Another method is to use vinegar, but it's not clear how this works."

IMAGE TRANSFER
FUJI INSTRUCTIONS
Worried about switching to Fuji film or having problems with transfers? We have the solution for creating great results.
Below are actual Fuji Transfers done in the light and a darkened room. Can you tell the difference?
You will discover that Fuji works similar to the old Polaroid. However, Fuji colors have always been much better and more correct than Polaroid. For those of you that are having problems with Fuji, the only thing
different from Polaroid is that you have to protect the Fuji negative from light only during the transfer process. If you are having any problems with Fuji film, please email sales@daylab.com and we will help you achieve the results you are after.
Important Update. The colors of Fuji film are much brighter and truer than Polaroid’s. Fuji also reveals more of the color of the paper it is put on. To avoid too much yellow, use a whiter
paper or add cyan and magenta filters to your Daylab prior to exposure. This will minimize or eliminate the yellow results some new users are complaining about.
You should be happy with any method you have been using with Polaroid film. The only difference is that the
Fuji Negative is more sensitive to light. Therefore you need to protect the sides from reflective light only when peeling apart. We suggest a box opened from the top. This solves the problem and makes it easy to
work with the negative. Everything else should be the same.
Method One using Strathmore Bristol Sheets, Plate Surface
Fuji film has a higher ISO than Polaroid 669. You need to protect the exposed film from light coming from the side when only during the few seconds you are applying it to the art paper. We have posted examples of
image transfer done in complete roomlight and a darkened room. Attach your hot press paper to a clipboard and set up in desired work area. Make you image using the Daylab. Immediately after pulling out the
film, cut off the end with the emulsion. Also cut off the other side of the exposed film set, but be sure to leave about a 1/2 tab. Fold the tab on the side of the original image back against the photo and place
this side against the paper on the clipboard. Insert the tab under the clip along with the paper. At this point, align the paper and image as you desire. Lift up the image and grab the tab that you bent back. With
your left hand, place pressure on the top of the clip and with the right hand grab the tab and in one brisk movement separate the positive and negative side of the film. The two will separate and the positive side
can be thrown away. Use your hand, using little pressure, smooth out the negative side so all of it is lying flat on the paper. Using the brayer roller, apply heavy pressure from the tab to the bottom of the image.
Do this motion twice and rotate the clip board 90 degrees. Repeat this motion twice. Again rotate 90 degrees. Continue this until you have completed a 360 rotation. Release the tab from underneath the clip but keep
the paper attached. Rest the brayer on top of the image near the tab. Apply light pressure and start moving the brayer down the image while simultaneously pulling the negative from the paper. Keep the negative and
the brayer pushed against each other while pulling the image off the paper.
Alternative Method Two
1. From 4x6 or 3d image on Copy System or slides on Slide printers, create a Fuji Print on FP-100C instant film.
2. Cut-off the top part of the negative/positive set approximately 1 inch above the film set. You can also cut off the bottom, approximately 1/2 below the film set if you want a cleaner transfer.
3. We use a clip board for our transfers to make it easier to align the film and art paper but you can do this on any hard surface. Place your choice of paper on the clip board under the clip. Place the
negative/positive set on top of the paper, with the negative (black side) up and the top 1” under the clip.
4. After a total of 15-30 seconds, carefully pull out the positive (white side) while pressing down on the negative. The longer you wait, the better the positive will look for possible emulsion lifts. We have been
successful doing this step in daylight by keeping the negative as close to the paper as possible while peeling off the positive. If you have problems in the beginning with daylight, either dim the lights or work in
as dark an environment as possible. The key is to minimize light from the sides.
5. Once the positive has been removed, tap down the negative with your fingers to secure in place. Every else can now be done in complete daylight.
6. Using your finger tips, apply pressure to the negative and rub across the complete negative to begin the transfer to the paper.
7. Use your roller for approximately 15-30 seconds to press the negative into the paper. It is best to work in one direction only to minimize shifting of the negative.
8. After a total of approximately 90 seconds, peel the negative from the art paper by applying pressure with the roller while peeling up the negative against the roller.
EMULSION LIFTS
2. Allow the negative/positive film set to develop for the full time, approximately 90 seconds.
3. Separate the positive and negative and place the positive in warm water, at least 120 degrees. The hotter the water the quicker the emulsion will separate from the backing but the lower the temperature the easier
it is to work with.
4. When the emulsion starts to separate, remove the positive to a tray of cool water. Carefully pull off the emulsion which will feel like a large decal. It can then be transferred to the surface you want to place it
on .
5. The emulsion can be transferred to any surface. We first coat the receiving surface with MOD PODGE MATTE-MAT (available at Michaels). Carefully place the emulsion on the surface you have coated and manipulate as
you desire. When it dries, you can coat the image to protect it. There are many other adhesives that will work as long as they are not quick drying.
Remember this is one of a kind art. Experiment to create your own individual style. If you come up with new techniques, please share them with us by emailing
sales@daylab.com . Be patient. It took many years for us to discover how to properly work with Polaroid 669. Even today we are still learning . The key is to have fun and be creative.",What is the main difference between using Fuji film and Polaroid film in the image transfer process?,"The main difference is that the Fuji Negative is more sensitive to light, therefore it needs to be protected from light only during the transfer process."

"OnePlus announced an essential strategic investment on Monday, confirming rumors that future phones will feature camera technology developed with Hasselblad. OnePlus said it’s going to invest $150 million in the next three years to better the camera experience, with Hasselblad playing a central role in that. It’s too early to tell whether we’re looking at a marketing push or whether the Hasselblad magic is indeed coming to OnePlus phones. OnePlus did not share more camera details during that announcement, but the OnePlus 9 phones will be the first to rock Hasselblad-branded camera models. OnePlus scheduled the launch event for March 23rd, at which point it will surely showcase the phones’ photo and video recording capabilities. But we don’t have to wait as long to see the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro in all their splendor, as both designs leaked in full ahead of the official launch.

It’s common for OnePlus handsets to leak well in advance of the press event, and we’ve always known what to expect from OnePlus handsets in terms of design and features. The OnePlus 9 design leaked before the Hasselblad announcement, hinting that a camera partnership was in the works. After the Hasselblad deal was official, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau teased the OnePlus 9 Pro design, showing the phone’s rear, including the quad-lens camera system that will feature Hasselblad branding.
It all begins with a simple thought. Discover the #OnePlus9Series, co-developed with @Hasselblad, on March 23.
— OnePlus (@oneplus) March 8, 2021
But it’s the same German blog that brings us the full press renders for both the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro. WinFuture found images that highlight the two designs. Lau’s teaser helps confirm the renders are genuine.
The OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro will not feature identical designs, with the forming sporting a couple of distinct design changes. The first concerns the screen, which is flat on the OnePlus 9 and curved on the OnePlus 9. This might be an advantage when it comes to handling drops. We saw Samsung earlier this year use flat screens for both the Galaxy S21 and S21+ models.
The OnePlus 9 also features what appears to be a plastic back, just like the cheaper Galaxy S21 phones. WinFuture notes that the phone’s chassis does not feature any antenna lines, which are customary on most handsets. “Glass sandwich phones,” which feature a metal chassis between the front and back glass panels, need those antenna lines so that the phone can communicate with cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
The OnePlus 9 Pro has antenna lines on the top, bottom, and sides. All Galaxy S21 handsets also feature antenna lines, even the two models that have plastic backs. It’s unclear why the OnePlus 9 doesn’t have any. The phone’s plastic back might be the reason why, but that’s just speculation.
Aside from these build quality observations, there’s one additional difference to consider. The OnePlus 9 Pro rear camera has four lenses, including a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 ultra-wide camera and a 48-megapixel IMX789 primary camera. Both of them are present on the OnePlus 9 as well. But the cheaper version has just three rear cameras on the back instead of four.
Finally, the leak gives us the various color options for the two phones. The OnePlus 9 Pro comes in black, green, and silver. The OnePlus 9 will be available in black, blue, and purple. You can see all the images at this link.

"LANSING, MI — In the minds of new business owners Paul Bussard and Paul Fox, wine is something everyone can enjoy.
With their new business, P Squared Wine Bar, the two Pauls hope to introduce downtown Lansing to wine in a non-intimidating fashion, providing a casual atmosphere and wines for every price range.
The bar and restaurant opened this week at 107 Washington Square South and offers 100 types of wines, including 20 Michigan varieties. A number of food options also are available.
Fox and Bussard, both Lansing natives, are passionate about wine and saw an opportunity to create a market for their passion in the heart of the downtown.
""We've been lovers of wine for quite a few years,"" Bussard said. ""We think we can carve a niche. Everyone we've talked to seems really excited that we're doing this.""
Bussard traces his own love of wine back to his second Iraq deployment while serving in the U.S. National Guard. When he was in Iraq, Bussard read a lot of material about wine and became interested in the history behind the drink.
""I couldn't drink it at the time, so I learned about it,"" he said.
Under Huntington National Bank's Small Business Associate's Patriot Express program, Bussard received a $120,000 loan to help get P Squared up and running as he transfers into civilian life, according to a press release from the bank.
Bussard and Fox have backgrounds in business and management, so once the idea was tossed around to get a wine bar up and running, it never went away. For more than a year, they've gone through exhaustive preparation to make sure their business will succeed, Fox said.
""Between the two of us, we have the confidence and skill set to make this a reality,"" Fox said.
Fox and Bussard consider themselves two normal guys who happened upon wine and loved it, so they plan on marketing it to everyone — not just wine snobs.
To help accomplish this, P Squared features several electronic menus on customized iPads that help customers as they determine which wines might suit their tastes. The iPads categorize the wine into various groupings such as price, flavor, region or complementary foods and allows customers to order right from their menus.
Fox said social media also has played a key factor in their business model. From the get-go, they've placed emphasis on their website and Twitter account to hype the business even before it opened.
Now that P Squared is open for business, Bussard said he's hopeful that hype translates into a prosperous new business in downtown Lansing where people can get together and enjoy wine for what it is — a delicious drink with a lot of history.
""I love to talk wine with people and get into the dorky, science side of it,"" he said. ""But even if people don't know anything about it, we want them to try. It's fun, and as long as it tastes good to you and you enjoy it, that's all that matters.""

"Just last night I had a few large files I wanted to bring to a friends house. They were HD videos that I took a long time ago and were about 7 GB in total. I figured I would just plop them on a USB drive and in a few minutes I’d be ready to go.
It didn’t quite work out so easily. 15 minutes after I tried to drag the files to the drive in Nautilus it wasn’t apparent that anything was happening. The progress bar had frozen, the flash drive was still doing something, and some of the files looked like they were there. I tried to do it again on the command line using “cp” and got the same results (with no progress bar). I knew there had to be a better way to copy these files and know what was actually going on but first I had to figure out what was really happening.
The initial discovery was that when “cp” copies a file to a vfat (FAT32) formatted flash drive it immediately allocates enough space for the entire file to fit. This is smart because it makes sure you can’t get stuck copying a file to a drive where it won’t fit. It’s also a pain because I can’t open another terminal window and see the file growing as it is being written to.
My next discovery was that disk caching was making the process difficult to understand. Nautilus appeared to copy the file quickly at first and then it just looked like it hung completely.
So I set out to write a script to fix these problems. I knew I wanted all of the following things:
A command-line utility – I wanted to be able to use this program without a GUI
A progress bar – I wanted to get visual feedback without babysitting the script
Files that “grew” while they were being copied – I wanted to be able to check it remotely in a different terminal session if necessary
Predictable behavior with regard to the disk cache – I couldn’t have the disk cache making it seem like the devices were writing very fast, then stalling, then writing very fast again
After an hour I came up with prcp.pl. It is a Perl script that uses mainly Term::ProgressBar and File::Sync to do what I needed. It’s not finished but it’s very functional. What it does is copy the file using sysread and syswrite while fsyncing the output file after each write. This forces what you see on the disk to be consistent with what the program is copying since it largely bypasses the disk cache.
If you’re brave give it a try and let me know what you think. Only use it on data that you have backed up since it has undergone minimal testing so far.",What issues did the person encounter when trying to copy large files to a USB drive?,"The person encountered several issues when trying to copy large files to a USB drive. The progress bar froze, it wasn't clear if the files were being transferred, and the flash drive seemed to still be processing something. Additionally, the person found that disk caching made the process difficult to understand, as it appeared to copy the file quickly at first and then seemed to hang completely."

Very nice atmosphere with friendly baristas who know how to properly make tea. (They also make coffee, of course, but I haven't tried it since I'm not a coffee person.) The shelves of evangelical Christian books on the wall were a little off putting to me since I'm not religious, but I love that donating to charity is a central part of their business.

Regarding the tea, they rather cleverly display their tea (made by Adagio) in small canisters on a magnetic rack so that you can smell them before deciding which one to try. I really appreciated the simplicity and practicality of this and wish more shops would do something similar (rather than waiting until you ask about their teas to offer to smell them). Overall, a great choice if you'd like an alternative to Starbucks in the Nashville area.",What is a unique feature of the tea display at The Well Coffee House?,The unique feature of the tea display at The Well Coffee House is that they cleverly display their tea in small canisters on a magnetic rack so that customers can smell them before deciding which one to try.
"Technology
The shipwrecks presented on this site lie beyond the capabilities of SCUBA. To work safely in Poseidon’s realm, the pioneering use of robotic technology is employed on wrecks.
Sites are discovered by towing side-scan sonar and magnetometer devices over large distances looking for anomalies in the seabed which can then be inspected further. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) outfitted with video cameras allow archaeologists on the surface ship to inspect the wreck without getting wet.
Before touching a wreck, its profile is recorded by telepresence. Multibeam sonar reconstruct a ship’s 3D contours. Thousands of photos are taken and digitally stitched together to provide a zoomable bird’s-eye view of a site. Sediments might be cored to assess a wreck’s buried survival or on the Victory warship (1744) sub-bottom imaging mapped the buried wreckage in 3D.
Surveying, recording and recoveries are all built around unmanned ROV’s (Remotely Operated Vehicles), the eyes and hands of archaeologists in the deep. These sophisticated robots are driven by hydraulic thrusters and can travel thousands of feet deep.
Deep-ocean pioneers Odyssey Marine Exploration built a proprietary archaeology ROV named ZEUS. This ROV.
Just like a physical grid on land, on the archaeological projects presented on this site, the team invented a digital grid to accurately log and map the position of every object from a tiny button to a large cannon. After artifacts are recovered, the story of a wreck is forensically reconstructed based on their original locations and contexts.

"9 Quirky Things Every 'Cool' Workplace Is Required to Have
#4. Scooters/Skateboards
Probably the most common symbol of the wacky workplace is the Razor scooter, or a skateboard, or some other child's toy that employees supposedly use to travel everywhere on campus.
Here's Pixar boss John Lasseter showing off the fun they have scooting around on scooters at Pixar:
Inside Pixar Animation Studios
Here's Mashable boss Pete Cashmore showing off the fun they have scooting around on scooters at Mashable:
Here's some dudes at PopCap Games showing off the fun they have scooting around on scooters at PopCap:
Here's some guy at Facebook showing off the fun they have skatboarding around on skateboards at Facebook:
And here's some parked scooters at Google New York that no one could be bothered to demonstrate for the tour:
At this point, it's been copied so much that you'll probably have to have your CEO putting around on a Big Wheel to get any attention.
LaughingSquid.com
Less dignity = more industry cred.
#3. Red Walls
Another thing that everybody does to stand out from each other that makes them all look alike is the red accent wall. Beige and white walls symbolize a dull, conventional office environment. Why not show how different you are by painting one wall bright red? Who else is going to do that? Other than Blend ...
... Autodesk ...
... Etsy ...
... YouTube ...
... TechStars ...
... Valve ...
... and many more, but you probably don't want to sit here looking at red walls all day. If you do, I have good news for you, the tech sector is hiring.
#2. Orange Couches
Red accent walls have nothing on orange couches though. I know it's easy to look at an orange couch and go, ""What if we had THIS in the office? Everybody has office couches but nobody has ORANGE ones, since it's such a bright and unconventional color!"" Apparently about 100 tech company decorators went to their various IKEAs at the same time and had the exact same thought.
That's why cutting edge workplaces like Google London ...
... Twitter ...
... PopCap ...
... Skype London ...
... Digg ...
... Mozilla ...
... Groupon ...
... Google Stockholm ...
... and a ton of other companies all look suspiciously similar.
#1. Slides
By this point, the frustrated office designer is tearing their hair out, seeing as every idea for making the office different is being used by every other office that wants be different. ""But wait!"" they go. ""I've got it! What if, instead of using the stairs, you took a SLIDE from the second floor to the first floor! That's NUTS!"" Sure, no one else would think of that. Just every Silicon Valley firm in the '90s. And every Google office today:
TheFlirtyBlog.com
Google headquarters.
Hoax-Slayer.com
Google Zurich.
New York Post
Google New York.
LaughingSquid.com
Google San Francisco - hey! Orange couch.
And YouTube.
And Red Bull.
And Epic Games.
And some office complex in England.
This isn't even a company. This is just an office building that some developer built and is going to rent out to a bunch of businesses, with the deal sweetener of, ""Also, it has a slide."" That's how ho-hum slides are now. You use them to sell office space to people.
Now a lot of these workplaces are a big step up from working at your average standard-cubicle distribution office or investment firm, sure. But the way they gush about these traits like they're reinventing the workplace or something is ridiculous considering how many other companies are doing the exact same things, in the exact same colors even. As far as who's really setting the bar for a ""different"" workplace, take a look at Inventionland:
Love it or hate it, you got to admit they don't half-ass it when trying to make a ""different"" kind of office. They're not just painting a wall red or bringing in a foosball table, they're planting their employees in the middle of goddamned Disneyland. I don't know if that helps them work or not but it sure as hell is commitment to being different.
When your average Nerf-gunning PR person brags to the media about how they're doing wacky, creative things with offices that nobody's done before, they should look at this place and hang their heads in shame. And then take down those stupid internet meme posters.

I have questions
Why am I always sitting behind the one person on the plane who immediately on take-off puts his seat into the extreme reclining position and stays there for the entire trip?

Yes! This is me too! Once I got strip searched and then at the gate, got 'randomly"" chosen. Needless to say, I burst into tears.
And I'm always behind the one person who lowers their seat all the way. I have very long legs - so this is painful.
it's really hard to believe that men designed planes -- I mean, most men look horridly uncomfy in the seats and have no room to move.
The trick is to arrive early & book the front row.
I always get the seat-kicking kid behind me. Sucky!
(shrinky - strip searched! Jesus!!)
My knees are usually pressed firmly agaisnt the seat in front of me on an airplane. This is because I am too tall for airplanes. And I HATE when the person in front of me tries to recline, because there is ZERO room as it is, and then we get into negative room and it is very uncomfortable.
I take a small amount of pleasure in knowing that they can only manage to recline an inch or two before my femurs stop any more movement. I sincerely hope this ruins there day.
You can blog from the airport? How? Did it require enormous sums of money?
What's the appropriate etiquette for seat reclining on long flights? I feel guilty for putting my seat back, still, but the pain of sitting upright for 9-14 hours usually wins out.
I'm feeling guilty about my usual good luck with searches/customs/annoying people now.
Shrinky, that's horrible!
I just flew first class for the first time ever and it was awesome. I didn't care when they searched my carry on (I think they do it when I stuff it so full even the X-ray machine can't see through it!). I didn't care when we were delayed. I didn't care about ANYTHING! It was awesome.
but usually I'm miserable, also stuck behind the seat leaners and since I'm tall I do what Jesse does and ram my knees into their back.
Lucy, I say seat leaning protcol is lean partially, but only lean all the way if a) they're kicking you before you even move b) it's super late at night and no is moving. I say never lean all the way back during the drink service. I hate having my drink shoved into my abdomen by the person in front of me.
Oh, you are the only one who always seem to sit behind the person who wants to recline the seat. I do wish airplanes just wouldn't make that an option. I tend to not recline so the person behind me can be comfortable (well, as comfortable as one can be on airplane with the limited space).
I think it's fair to recline if it's that pseudo night time that airlines do half way through long flights -- serve dinner and then dim all the lights. Also, if the person behind you has reclined, then you can too. But not in the middle of the day in a one hour flight, especially if you aren't even trying to sleep.
Shrinky -- being strip searched sounds horrific! You must _really_ look like a terrorist! :)
Lucy -- Sydney airport has free internet in the international terminal. Not wireless, sadly, so you have to queue, but still, I think it's very cool.
Betty -- I flew business class once, and I loved the fantastic amount of seat room, the food, and so on, but the amount of personal attention and service you get made me feel really uncomfortable. Like, as I sat down, the steward came up to ask if I wanted a glass of champagne. Just then, while he was standing in the aisle waiting for my answer, a harried looking mother with two kids tried to get past to her seat in economy. Instead of moving aside, the steward glared at her and asked her to wait to one side while he got my drink.
I HATED that. But otherwise business class was awesome. I can only dream about what first class must be like!
oh, I didn't think of connecting airports. That's not quite so exciting.

"The festive season is nearly upon us, the new year is looming, staff are flagging and looking
forward to a few days off. If you work in retail – not a chance, prepare for the onslaught – Christmas and the January sales. If you work in an office or a manufacturing environment, you might be in luck. Many offices and factories close for at least the three bank holidays, some even close for the three working days between Christmas and New Year. Us, well we are closing for a few extra days as well.
We all need a break and recharging the batteries is absolutely essential to achieving an engaged workforce who are healthy, motivated and highly focused on delivering a fantastic service to clients. In many companies the annual leave (holiday) year runs in line with the annual calendar and therefore for many, this is the last opportunity to take unused holiday time. Many companies operate a ‘use it or lose it’ policy and as long as they have given employees the opportunity to use the time, the onus is on the employee to ensure they ‘claim’ everything they are entitled to.
It is really important that an annual leave policy is clearly documented: that staff know when they can take their holiday, what their entitlement is, how bank holidays are treated and are aware of any ‘black out periods’ when the business is at it’s busiest and holiday can not be taken.
Rules such as the number of staff allowed to be off at any one time and any priority given to parents required to take leave during the school holidays should be communicated so that expectations are managed appropriately.
Good practice dictates that managers ensure leave is spread throughout the year and that staff know what holiday time they have left. They should be encouraged to have used at least half of their leave before the end of Q3 with the rest of their leave planned, authorised and booked appropriately.
Holiday pay can be confusing for some employees and the complexity may occur with part time or term time only staff. It is essential that the contract of employment provides the formula for calculating holiday pay and / or holiday entitlement. All entitlements for part time staff must be pro rated based on the full time entitlements i.e. if the normal working week is 40 hours and an employee works 20 hours, they are a 0.5 full time equivalent (FTE). Therefore the annual leave entitlement is pro rated and if the full time employee has 30 days holiday including bank holidays, the part time employee has 15 days including the public and bank holidays which fall on their normal working days.
Ensure your employees have the opportunity to recharge their batteries – it will be better for your business.

"Abstract
The gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier for pathogens to initiate infection. Despite this barrier, enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), successfully penetrate the intestine to initiate infection and spread systemically prior to shedding in stool. However, the effect of the gastrointestinal barrier on CVB3 population dynamics is relatively unexplored, and the selective pressures acting on CVB3 in the intestine are not well characterized. To examine viral population dynamics in orally infected mice, we produced over 100 CVB3 clones harboring nine unique nucleotide “barcodes.” Using this collection of barcoded viruses, we found diverse viral populations throughout each mouse within the first day postinfection, but by 48 h the viral populations were dominated by fewer than three barcoded viruses in intestinal and extraintestinal tissues. Using light-sensitive viruses to track replication status, we found that diverse viruses had replicated prior to loss of diversity. Sequencing whole viral genomes from samples later in infection did not reveal detectable viral adaptations. Surprisingly, orally inoculated CVB3 was detectable in pancreas and liver as soon as 20 min postinoc-ulation, indicating rapid systemic dissemination. These results suggest rapid dissemination of diverse viral populations, followed by a major restriction in population diversity and monopolization in all examined tissues. These results underscore a complex dynamic between dissemination and clearance for an enteric virus. IMPORTANCE Enteric viruses initiate infection in the gastrointestinal tract but can disseminate to systemic sites. However, the dynamics of viral dissemination are unclear. In this study, we created a library of 135 barcoded coxsackieviruses to examine viral population diversity across time and space following oral inoculation of mice. Overall, we found that the broad population of viruses disseminates early, followed by monopolization of mouse tissues with three or fewer pool members at later time points. Interestingly, we detected virus in systemic tissues such as pancreas and liver just 20 min after oral inoculation. These results suggest rapid dissemination of diverse viral populations, followed by a major restriction in population diversity and monopolization in all examined tissues.

"Jacob
Jacob (Hebrew: יַעֲקֹב, Standard Yaʿaqov Tiberian Yaʿăqōḇ; Arabic: يعقوب, Yaʿqūb; ""holds the heel""), also known as Israel (Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל, Standard Yisraʾel Tiberian Yiśrāʾēl; Arabic: اسرائيل, Isrāʾīl; ""Struggled with God""), is the third Biblical patriarch. Jacob was the son of Isaac, the grandson of Abraham, twin brother of Esau., Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Joseph, and Benjamin.[1]
Jacob , together with his older brother Esau, was born to Isaac and Rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when his father was 60,[2] and Abraham was 160 years old. He and Esau were markedly different in appearance and behaviour. Esau was a ruddy hunter, while Jacob was a gentle man who ""dwelled in tents,"" interpreted by many biblical commentators as a mark of his studiousness and reserved personality.
During Rebecca's pregnancy, ""the children struggled together within her"". favoured by his mother, while Esau was favoured by his father. which belonged to Esau as the older brother. Esau agreed, commenting, ""I am going to die — what is this birthright to me?"" The fact that Esau would sell his familial rights in exchange for soup indicates the disdain in which he held his fathers' traditions. In the words of the Bible, ""Esau despised the birthright.""[4] However, there are many interpretations of this statement. Some believe he meant that if he were dead, then his brother would have the birthright anyway; why should he die? If Esau were not to sell his birthright, he may have died from starvation, giving Jacob the birthright either way..
Rebecca saw,"" but when they were complete, Laban deceived Jacob by switching his older daughter, Leah, as the veiled bride.
[According to the traditional Midrashic interpretation of the story (not part of the story given in Genesis), finally married Rachel, but he continued to work for Laban another seven years.. Afterwards, Leah became fertile again and gave birth to Issachar, Zebulun, and Dinah. At this point, God remembered Rachel, who gave birth to Joseph and Benjamin.
Various interpretations of biblical passages suggest that Jacob's favoritism of Rachel over Leah passed over to their children. Some commentators feel that this rivalry played an important role in the later attempt on Joseph's life by his half-brothers.who?
Around the time that Joseph was born, Jacob decided to return home to his parents, but Laban was reluctant to release him, as. (See an illustration of the genetics behind this deal) 'household idols' idols back. Knowing nothing about Rachel's theft of the idols, Jacob told Laban that whoever stole them should die, and offered to let him search. When Laban reached Rachel's tent, she hid the idols by sitting on them. Jacob and Laban parted from each other in peace, Laban returning home and Jacob continuing on his way... Christian commentators have speculated that this was a punishment from God due to Jacob's earlier sins, which included impersonation of Esau (a form of lying or deception).citation needed
Nearly ten years after the sale of Joseph, Pharaoh had two troubling dreams which could not be interpreted to his satisfaction. Joseph, who was in the king's prison, was recommended to Pharaoh as an interpreter of dreams, and he, the sons of Jacob went down had twelve sons by his four wives, as follows:
These 12 sons comprise the twelve Tribes of Israel. The names of these tribes were recorded on the vestments of the Kohen Gadol (high priest). However, when the land of Israel was apportioned among the tribes in the days of Joshua, the Tribe of Levi, being priests, did not receive land. Therefore, when the tribes are listed in reference to their receipt of land, as well as to their encampments during the 40 years of wandering in the desert, the Tribe of Joseph is replaced by the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (the two sons of Joseph by his Egyptian wife Asenath, whom Jacob elevated to the status of full tribes). during their long exile, which continues to the present day. (Genesis 48:8-20), this is seen as a foreshadowing of the blessings Christians believe resulted from Jesus' death on the cross.
In Arabic, Jacob is known as Yaqub. He is revered as a prophet who received inspiration from God. The Qur'an does not give the details of Jacob’s life. It is said that he was later honored by God with the name Isra'il (Israel in English) (Yisrael in Hebrew) because of his devotion and dedication to God's will. Isra' means Night Journey and Il simply means God (Allah) (similar to the word El in Semitic Language meaning God). Yaqub was said to have migrated somewhere in a night journey with his children and later favored by God with this name.",Who are the twelve sons of Jacob according to the biblical context?,"The twelve sons of Jacob are Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Joseph, Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh (the two sons of Joseph by his Egyptian wife Asenath, whom Jacob elevated to the status of full tribes)."

Is Chris Kreider a top contender for the Calder Trophy? -- @surlysailor
Indeed he is among the top contenders for the Calder Trophy. In fact, our own Jon Lane wrote that Kreider would win the Calder Trophy if it were handed out today. Kreider, though, has serious competition from the likes of Nathan MacKinnon, Valeri Nichushkin and Aleksander Barkov. What I like about Kreider's game is how physical he is. He's a powerful player with a particularly strong lower body. His legs power him, and he's using them better this season than he has in the past. He's been an effective player since coming back from the AHL. As long as he continues to use his legs, Kreider should be able to create offense and stay in the Calder race.
The Capitals, Hurricanes, Blues and Ducks have an abundance of goalies. Who moves and who is interested? -- @paulfrank17
I can see the Washington Capitals and St. Louis Blues potentially making moves. The Carolina Hurricanes shouldn't do anything as long as Cam Ward is on injured reserve. The Anaheim Ducks are in the same position with Viktor Fasth. The other thing with Anaheim is that Frederik Andersen does not have to clear waivers, so if Fasth returns, they can send Andersen to the AHL without any concern. Trading Jonas Hiller would be a mistake even though he's in the final year of his contract. He's been excellent, and Anaheim is a contending team.
The funny thing with the Blues is they could actually be in the market for a goalie even though they have Jaroslav Halak, Brian Elliott and Jake Allen. Blues general manager Doug Armstrong may try to acquire Ryan Miller from the Buffalo Sabres before the NHL Trade Deadline on March 5. He'd likely want to trade Elliott or Halak in the deal. They're scheduled to be unrestricted free agents after the season.
In Washington, Philipp Grubauer's play is making Michal Neuvirth appear expendable, especially since Braden Holtby is better than he has played and simply needs his confidence back to be good again. Neuvirth carries a $2.5 million salary-cap charge next season. It would make sense for the New York Islanders to make a play for him.
Where do you rank John Tavares as far as player rankings? Third behind Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin? -- @notFABRIZI
Player rankings are difficult because Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin are completely different players, so how do you rank them? I know that sounds like a cop out, but it's true. How do you rank a pure goal-scorer next to a playmaking center? I will always lean toward the playmaking center as being more valuable player because he makes other players around him better. But the goal-scorer can be the game-breaker. Ovechkin is the best scorer in the NHL.
That said, to answer your question, I'd put Tavares behind Crosby, Pavel Datsyuk, Jonathan Toews and Steven Stamkos, but a notch ahead of Ovechkin. But like I said, I'm a big believer in the playmakers because they make the goal-scorers better, not the other way around.
What country will be the biggest potential dark horse in Sochi? -- @the_saad
Finland. It seems like people always take the Finns for granted, but they're the only country that has medaled three times since NHL players started participating in the Olympics 16 years ago. They have arguably the deepest goaltending in the tournament with Tuukka Rask, Antti Niemi and Kari Lehtonen. Minus Saku Koivu, they have the same core as they usually do, plus they have some young studs in Aleksander Barkov and Olli Maatta. They know how to play the big-ice game. The one question I have is will their defense hold up, but I'm on the lookout for the Finns.",Who are the top contenders for the Calder Trophy according to Jon Lane?,"Chris Kreider, Nathan MacKinnon, Valeri Nichushkin and Aleksander Barkov are among the top contenders for the Calder Trophy according to Jon Lane."

The XRD analyses were performed on both bulk powder samples and clay fraction separated from the sample. The nest material was crushed using mortar and pestle to obtain a fine powder. The powder samples were analyzed using an PANalytical X-Pert Pro, using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The samples were scanned over a sampling range of 2.5 to 70°2θ with a step size of 0.0066 and a scan speed of 0.023°2θ per second. For each nest, triplicate samples were used for bulk analyses and duplicate samples for separated clay fraction analyses with and without chemical treatment. As the clay particles (<2 μm in size) generally do not show clear diffraction patterns in bulk samples with random orientation, the clay fraction was separated from the bulk sample upon dispersion of the powder using an ultrasonic bath. Centrifugation of the samples at 1000 rpm for 2 min was used to separate the heavier fraction, whereas the clay was left in suspension. The clay suspended fluid was then put on glass rounds, the clay was allowed to settle, and the material was left to dry to generate oriented mounts for XRD analysis. The air-dried clay fraction samples and glycol-solvated clay fraction samples were used to identify different clays present in the samples. Moreover, some clay fractions were treated with 1 N HCl to confirm the absence of chlorite in the samples.
The diffraction analyses on the bulk samples of both nests show peaks of quartz (45); however, the Guinea sample also shows the presence of kaolinite and hematite (fig. S1). The XRD analysis on the separated clay fraction shows peaks of kaolinite and smectite in the Senegal sample and peaks of kaolinite and illite in the Guinea samples. The integrated intensities of the characteristic peaks were used for quantification of the relative mineral abundance in the samples. Separated fractions of different minerals are reported in table S1.",What method was used to analyze the powder samples in the experiment?,"The powder samples were analyzed using an PANalytical X-Pert Pro, using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA."

"The tagging plugin is a great way for you or the members of your community to ""tag"" content with appropriate keywords. Using the Tagging plugin also adds a couple of other benefits to your community:
- It can help with discovery of content because you and members of your community can see what content is creating discussions.
- It improves SEO by making it easier for search engine robots to crawl community content
- It adds a new dimension to Advanced Search, allowing searches by tags.
Ready to learn more? Let's jump in and look a bit deeper into how to use the Tagging add-on.
How to enable the Tagging Plugin
The first step is to enable the Tagging add-on. The administrator of a Vanilla community can enable the Tagging add-on by heading into the browse add-on section in the Dashboard and by clicking ""enable"":
Once enabled, you will have an optional settings pages, which can be accessed by clicking ""Settings"":
Or, you can access it from the newly-created sidebar menu option under the ""Forum"" heading:
The following is an example of a dashboard with some tags already populated:
From the the dashboard you can:
- Edit an existing tag by clicking on it. Great when a tag is created with a typo.
- Change the url slug of the tag (also by clicking on the appropriate tag)
- You can delete a tag, by clicking the 'x' next to it. Only the tag will be removed, not the content.
- You can add new tag, or see what tags have been already added.
- See how many times a tag has been used.
The tags in this list will be available for members of the community to select when they create a discussion or they can add their own on the front end (more on that in next section).
If you wish to see what content the tag is associated to, go to the frontend of your community and click on the tag of your choice in the tag cloud.
Please note: The bestof and reaction tabs (and tags) are not editable. They are there for reference purposes only. You can modify their names in the Reactions plugin.
How Community Members can add Tags
When Tagging is enabled, members with permissions can add tags, be offered Tag keyword suggestions via auto complete, and they can also select from popular tags already in use by the community. The following GIF shows Tagging in action (on the frontend):
How to customize
Tags can be customized to the look and feel of your community. You can change the colors of the tags in your sidebar, or just the color of certain tags. Each tag has its own class.
So if you wanted the ""3d software"" tag to be green, you can add the following to your css:
li a.Tag_3d-software {
background-color: #00e600 !important;
}
You can also change the background of all tags to be green (or whatever color you want) by applying styling to
.TagCloud in your theme.
How to use permissions with tagging
If you decide you want to control who has access to add tags, you can modify the permission of the specific role to have the ability to add tags.
Members will still be able to select from the list of created tags, they will simply not be able to create new tags your team or those with permission have not already created.
We hope this helps you get started with tagging. If you wish to see more of it in action, you can check out this video:

While news of the soon-to-begin travel bubble with Australia has been met with excitement by travel lovers and people with family over the ditch, the agriculture sector is hoping it will lead to more foreign workers being allowed into the country.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the bubble - which means quarantine-free travel between New Zealand and Australia - will begin on April 19.
The Government says doing away with quarantine for those arriving from Australia will free up between 1000 and 1300 rooms per fortnight in managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities.
Although around 500 of those spaces will be kept as ""contingency should they be needed for the trans-Tasman arrangement"", the bubble means there are now hundreds of more places available in MIQ.
Now, with many primary industries continuing to face severe labour shortages, there are calls for those free spaces to go to foreign workers in the farming, horticulture and viticulture sectors.
""MIQ spacing has been continually quoted as a barrier for getting the workers we need,"" Federated Farmers immigration spokesperson Chris Lewis said on Wednesday.
""With more beds becoming available [the Government] should now allow those with agricultural skills to enter the country.""
Lewis said Federated Farmers acknowledged the Government had already made some limited border exceptions for agricultural machinery operators, veterinarians, sheep shearers, animal pregnancy scanners and some skilled dairy staff. However, ""these limited exceptions aren't going to go very far with the number of workers needed across the primary industries in the coming months,"" he said.
""With continued low unemployment and the majority of available workers remaining in the urban centres, all of the primary industries are crying out for labour.""
Mike Chapman, chief executive of Horticulture New Zealand, told Newshub he was also hopeful some of the free MIQ spots would go to migrant agriculture workers.
Although the Government granted border exemptions for 2000 recognised seasonal employer (RSE) workers from Pacific countries, that only went a small way to covering the total shortfall of between 5000 and 10,000 workers the industry faced during the peak harvest period.
It's estimated the lack of workers will cost the sector hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, with the labour shortage forcing many growers to leave fruit to rot on trees.
Chapman said the agreement with Australia is a ""good start"" but even if some of the MIQ places do go to workers in the horticulture industry, it comes too late to help growers during the busy harvest period.
However, he said, ""in terms of winter pruning it's not too late"".
""If there was some movement through these spaces at MIQ it would be a great assistance to the winter pruning and also it would flow through into the spring crop,"" he said.
""So it would be an enormous assistance.""
But while it is important to get workers into the country in time for winter, Chapman said the real focus was avoiding another labour shortage next harvest season.
""To avoid what happened this year we really need to go back to making the RSE scheme work as it always has - a two-way flow of workers up to the cap of 14,400.""
He said the best way for that to happen was through vaccinations and ""a new system that doesn't involve MIQ"".
When asked about the issue on Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor told reporters he ""certainly will be advocating for more RSE workers to be brought in"" if there is an opportunity to do so.
""We'll certainly be putting forward the case that should there be any MIQ space available from the trans-Tasman bubble that some of those places be available for horticulture and agriculture workers,"" he said.
However, that would have to be balanced by the fact there are still many New Zealanders wanting to come home as well as other sectors calling for essential workers to be given access to MIQ facilities, he said.
COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said a decision on how to best utilise the extra MIQ rooms was likely later this month.
""The Government will consider the best ways to use the remaining rooms over the coming weeks, including the option of finding more places for people from the Pacific, including the RSE workforce,"" Hipkins said in a statement to Newshub.
""[Immigration] Minister [Kris] Faafoi continues to engage with the horticulture and wine sectors around workforce needs, and he reiterates that industries put together plans to better attract New Zealanders and onshore migrants into work.""",What is the expected impact of the travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia on the agriculture sector in New Zealand?,"The agriculture sector in New Zealand is hoping that the travel bubble with Australia will lead to more foreign workers being allowed into the country.

The agriculture sector wants these free spaces to go to foreign workers in the farming, horticulture and viticulture sectors to address severe labour shortages."

The Ethnic Communities of the East Side, Niagara Falls, NY
From Niagara County Genealogical Society website:
Saturday May 30, 2015 at 1pm
The Niagara County Genealogical Society hosted the program, “Ethnic Communities of the East Side of Niagara Falls.” According to an informal housing survey conducted by Elsie Vorhees Jones, at least fourteen non-English speaking nationalities resided in the city of Niagara Falls in June of 1919. Michelle Kratts, librarian at the Lewiston Public Library spoke about how these immigrants settled on the East Side in what became known as “Tunnel Town” and through their customs and traditions contributed to the unique and rich cultural history of the city of Niagara Falls. She explored the stories of these people as well as the historical and genealogical records that may be searched to find clues to their origins.

Where do you see yourself in 10 years? I see myself as leading the Florida Treasury Management team at PNC as an established brand leader in all major Florida markets. I will be looking for new ways to challenge myself through leadership roles in community and civic organizations.
What’s the best part of your day? Coming home to my children’s smiling faces after a great day at work.
Diaz’s 12-year banking career in Tampa Bay has been with three financial institutions: SunTrust, BankAtlantic and finally PNC. In August, she was promoted to lead the entire Florida Corporate Treasury Management sales team, from Miami to Tallahassee.
Diaz supports a number of charities but Junior Achievement is the organization she supports most. “I had great mentors in my life and I am now passing it on to the next generation,” she said in submission materials.",What is the organization that Suzanne Diaz supports the most?,The organization that Suzanne Diaz supports the most is Junior Achievement.
"RENO, Nev. --.
It's a work out that can burn around 500 calories in just thirty minutes, which means if you have a free lunch hour, you can pop in, get a full body work out, take a shower and have just enough time to get back in the office.
""I have an elliptical in my living room for crying out loud that I don't get on."" said Tammy Wadsworth, a kickboxing novice.
Like many other mothers, Tammy Wadsworth can barely fit time in her schedule to sleep, let alone work out.
""I'm a full-time working individual, I have a daughter and family and all those other commitments that come with being an adult and plenty of excuses for not going to the gym,"" she said.
When Wadsworth found 9Round Fitness & Kickboxing three months ago, she ran out of excuses.
'I didn't have to worry about making a 6 p.m, class or making a 5:30 p.m. class when I work late and it just gets me 30 minutes in and out,"" she said. ""it kicks my butt.""
A half an hour gets you through nine different workouts, each round lasting three minutes. Once the bell goes off, you're onto a new routine.
""Every day it changes so you get a fresh new work out every time you step into the place,"" said Matt Vidal, manager and head trainer at 9Round.
It's not a one-size-fits-all kind of class. Each round is tailored to your needs, which keep folks like Tammy Wadsworth coming back.
When I first started, I couldn't get through 9Rounds. I thought I was going to pass out, honestly.""
Three months later, she's seeing results that keep her motivated.
""I'm seeing more definition, I'm seeing just increased energy and muscles. Clothes fit better, always a bonus.""
Each class also guarantees a personal trainer right by your side to encourage and teach you new routines.
""It's a great cardio work out. Everybody that wants to lose the pounds, get rid of this get rid of that; it's all about cardio burning; it's not about getting big bulky muscle,"" Vidal said. ""If you want a nice lean summer body, this is where you get it.""

"Whenever friends tell me they are feeling blue, I tell them to take a weekend, stock up on cold seltzer, and binge “Pose.” The show, which aired on FX last year, takes place in the spangled, sparkling demimonde of the New York drag-ball scene in the nineteen-eighties, where glamour met house music met vibrant queer expression met a hot-glue gun and a prayer. The show is a Funfetti cake of visual pleasure, and one of the highlights is Billy Porter, who plays the ballroom m.c. Pray Tell, barking orders from the stage in neon-green suits and enormous fedoras. Porter, who also has had major success on Broadway (he won a Tony for playing the drag queen Lola in “Kinky Boots”), has been making the most of the press circuit for his show’s début season, working every red carpet that he has appeared on this year with a zeal and creativity that makes everyone else look drab. At the A.F.I. Awards, in January, Porter wore a floor-length gown the color of farm-fresh egg yolks beneath a golden blazer. At the Golden Globes, two days later, he wore a hot-pink cloak, displaying the garment like a bird of paradise flapping its way through a mating dance. And, at the Critics’ Choice Awards, he wore a chocolate satin suit with a comically oversized soft-peach bow at the hip, a fanciful caricature of a cummerbund.
On the Oscars red carpet, on Sunday night, Porter managed to outdo himself yet again. He wore a “tuxedo gown” by the designer and “Project Runway” winner Christian Siriano, a sumptuous collision of butch-femme aesthetics.. Porter, who interviewed celebrities on the red carpet as part of ABC’s pre-show special, was one of the first people to arrive, and his dramatic look felt like a dare to everyone who would follow..
In a piece for Vogue about his Oscars outfit, Porter recalled approaching Siriano at the after-party for the designer’s most recent fashion show. He had learned that he’d be hosting a pre-Oscars show for ABC, and he asked Siriano if he’d make him a gown. (Siriano’s response: “AAAAA-BSOLUTELY.”) Porter wrote that he wanted to wear the gown in order to play with the gender binary, to melt the lines between masculine and feminine that red-carpet conventions tend to reinforce. “My goal is to be a walking piece of political art every time I show up. To challenge expectations. What is masculinity? What does that mean?” Porter’s outfit set a tone for the evening. So much of the history of the Oscars is about good behavior: wearing tasteful, elegant gowns, thanking the right people when you graciously accept your statuette. But, as Richard Brody wrote, in a piece sharing his awards predictions, as long as the Oscars remains a “stodgy, sometimes shticky, backward-looking self-celebration of a wealthy, and mostly white and male, industry,” it will be at risk of becoming irrelevant in a changing world. Stars like Porter, who strutted the red carpet as assistants helped fluff out the hemline of his skirt, are using fashion to show one route forward for the festivities. “People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown,” he wrote. “But it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”","Who designed the ""tuxedo gown"" that Billy Porter wore to the Oscars?","The ""tuxedo gown"" that Billy Porter wore to the Oscars was designed by Christian Siriano, a ""Project Runway"" winner."

I felt so validated no matter what level I’m at! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed listening to Henckel.
He makes the understanding of the creation and the Absolute astonishing clear…just the bare bones.
The silence was palable….beautiful…I felt I was touching my true nature.
Thankyou.
A very honest interview. Thank you.
I liked it very much. However I find myself longing to hear him talk about these ideas in the context of the system of yoga. He mentioned this very briefIy in the talk and it had such a strong resonance for me. I hope this may be possible in the future?
Very inspiring. It was a beautiful lift for me. I feel most fortunate to have the chance to hear this again and again. A very special thing to speak so clearly of something so great and mystical – thank you for sharing.
I have studied with henckel my dearest teacher, for many years.
The truth of the teaching is in the way it is manifested in real life.
Myteacher does not need to make himself known.
He is an example of everything he teaches , compassion ,clarity,and pure being.

understanding and deep presence.

I have enjoyed the pod cast in it’s considered and honest delivery, to Henkel’s journey of his enlightenment.
I am blessed to be a part of his group in which he so generously shares and teaches what he knows. I feel I have grown and changed since joining it and like so often happens other things appear to happen, like books that were given to me, aiding the continuing process.
I have now listen to it a second time and I am sure I will do so again in the future. there is so much more I heard the second time than the first time round. Thank you Henkel!

that leaves a bad impression, giving few clues to his
future greatness. After sitting through a ridiculous
tale that is filled with plot holes as large as
California, a contrived happy ending is suddenly
thrown in without being earned. This oddity cheapie
film, making its way in the world of noir, was flatly
photographed and the screenplay lacked polish.
Nora Goodrich (Brenda Marshall) is a dedicated
research scientist at the Mindret Wilmott Chemical
Institute in New York, where she's occupied with her
breakthrough experiment for a new anesthetic and also
looking forward to marrying her scientist colleague,
Dr. Stephan Lindstrom (William Gargan), upon the
experiment's conclusion. While backing out of a
garage, Nora accidentally knocks down a drunk woman,
Jane Karaski (Ruth Ford), who mistakenly walked in her
path. The woman is only mildly shaken, but
ambulance-chasing attorney J. W. Rinse suddenly
appears and gives Jane his card and urges her to sue.
Nora drives the woman home and gives her $25, quite
sure everything is okay. That night Stephan comes over
to Jane's apartment and proposes marriage for tomorrow
because the institute is transferring him to their
Paris office immediately. Nora says she can't marry
him until the experiment is completed. Stephan tells
her to think it over and leaves when Nora's beautiful
lab assistant Arline Cole (Hillary Brooke) enters,
she's here to assist an unauthorized experiment at
home as the anxious Nora forgoes clinical tests to
test the formula out on herself. While asleep, the
formula was tinkered with by Arline and it explodes
just as Stephan returns to pick up his briefcase he
accidentally left behind. Stephan puts out the flames,
but Nora is taken to the hospital and suffers from
severe burns to her face--leaving her disfigured.
Arline then uses the opportunity to come between the
couple and schemes to get Stephan to fall for her, as
she has the hospital prevent Stephan from visiting her
and bad mouths Stephan for deserting her because she's
no longer pretty. Nora leaves the hospital and is
confronted at gunpoint by a crazed Jane, who tells her
that the lawyer said the suit is worth $25,000 and
demands that money. When Nora says she doesn't have
that kind of money, Jane steals her engagement ring
and wallet but Nora tussles with her and in the
struggle Jane falls to her death off the penthouse
balcony. The dead woman is identified as Nora, so the
real Nora decides to go to Los Angeles for plastic
surgery and assume Jane's identity. After a year in
the hospital, Jane reads in the newspapers that Arline
married Stephan. She returns to New York unrecognized,
where she gets hired by Stephan to be his research
assistant by coming off as Nora's best friend since
they studied chemistry together at the University of
Vermont. Nora soon learns that Arline caused her
disfigurement and acts to win Stephan back. The two
are planning to go to Paris together without Arline,
when Nora's arrested at the airport for the murder of
Nora, as the shyster lawyer points her out to the
police so he could collect the reward. The nightmare
story ends in the police station with a bogus surprise
ending that left me feeling used.

GRADE: C
Dennis Schwartz: ""Ozus' World Movie Reviews""
SCHWARTZ",Who is the director of the film reviewed by Dennis Schwartz?,The film was directed by Anthony Mann.
"[dropcap]D[/dropcap]o moral victories exist in the minds of NBA players? Do they consider the difficult circumstances, appreciate their team’s effort, and accept the fact that, although they lost, they played really well? The short answer is probably not. Yet when the Celtics (36-30) gave the Heat, a team that has seemed untouchable throughout their 23-game winning streak, everything that the defending champs could handle on Monday night, it’s hard to believe that the C’s didn’t gain some confidence.
At first, it was the Celts that were untouchable, as Jeff Green led his squad to a 17-point lead midway through the second quarter. With Kevin Garnett sidelined due to a sore abductor muscle and flu-like symptoms, Boston needed to essentially play a perfect game, and Green’s 22 points on 8-10 shooting from the field at that point was just the type of transcendent performance that they required. It was reminiscent of perhaps the greatest upset in NCAA Championship history, when the 8th Seeded Villanova Wildcats defeated a Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown Hoyas squad that was heavily favored. The ‘Cats only managed to win by two because they shot an incredible 78 percent from the field, and during their 17-0 run in the second quarter the Celitcs hit 11 of 13 field goal attempts as they set a similar pace against the Heat.
However, as the adrenaline wore off, the Heat keyed in on Green defensively, and the C’s began to turn the ball over at a rapid rate, their lead slowly shrank. The Heat (54-16) trimmed the deficit to six at the half, opened the third quarter on a 6-0 run, and looked as though they would take control of the game. The Celtics continued to hold them off through a combination of feisty defense, transition offense, and timely three-point shooting, but ended up coming up a few plays shy of a miraculous victory.
It would have been miraculous because the absence of K.G., which was not a huge factor against an opponent like the Bobcats, was glaringly apparent on Monday. Boston held Miami to only six fast break points, which is less than half of what the Heat average per game this season, but the C’s squandered their large lead by committing several defensive miscues in the half court. There’s no way to track exactly how many points the Celts allowed due to lack of communication, yet without their defensive leader, they allowed a stunning 50 points in the paint. The Heat found their offensive rhythm by exploiting the C’s interior defense for lay-ups and dunks as Boston’s players shrugged their shoulders and wondered who was to blame.
The Celtics ended up turning the ball over 20 times, as their offense gradually slowed down to crawl. Yet a deep three from Jordan Crawford, a contested corner three by Courtney Lee, and a clutch triple from the opposite corner courtesy of Avery Bradley kept the C’s ahead towards the end of this game. Although Paul Pierce’s questionable fade-away three-point attempt went awry with seven seconds left to play, there were plenty of positives in the last two minutes.
Mainly the play of Green, who stepped into the starting lineup again to provide a career-high 43 points along with seven rebounds, and four blocks. While he was stellar offensively, it was Green’s defense that nearly made the difference down the stretch, and should inspire confidence for Celtics’ fans in the playoffs. Three times the Heat cleared out an entire side of the floor for LeBron James, and Green stopped him in a one-on-one situation three times. Even though LeBron got the best of him on the fourth occasion by rattling in a 20-footer with 10 seconds to play, Green has proven that he can check the greatest player in the game during clutch situations.
Despite the loss, this Celtics team has clearly shown an ability to come together in the face of adversity. Boston has always been a franchise with championship pedigree, but this group is showing a different type of determination. They seem to rise to the occasion whenever the stakes are high, and to exceed expectations when their doubted most. The C’s attitude shouldn’t change much after a narrow defeat without their defensive MVP, because in some sense, their shorthanded loss to the best team in the Eastern Conference was in fact a moral victory.

"Today over lunch, my friend Amal Kirtan asked me how I'm finding his home country of Brazil.
""I am feeling so deeply fortunate."" I replied. ""Amazed. The devotees here seem to live with their hearts on their sleeves. They give their whole hearts in service. No walls.""
""Indeed, Brazilians have very open hearts,"" Amal Kirtan agreed.
""Yes! But I am wondering, Prabhu - if their hearts are so open, don't their hearts also get hurt much more easily?""
Amal Kirtan shook his head, ""Brazilians have very strong hearts. It's very hard to break a Brazilian heart,""
My eyes widened and I leaned forward in my seat. ""But why? How come??""
""Brazilians give and love with all their hearts, and if it gets hurt they also let it go. They know how to let go.""
I leaned back in my seat. ""Wow. They don't get so bitter or angry,""
""No, that's American!"" Amal Kirtan laughed, and I laughed, too.
Brazilians seem to live the open secret: let love flow.

"TIME spoke to Dan Fabricant, who recently became the head of the Natural Product Association (NPA) after serving as director of the dietary supplement programs at the FDA. Fabricant is no newbie to the NPA, though. Prior to leaving for the federal agency in 2011, Fabricant was president of global government and scientific affairs at the NPA. We asked him about making the switch between industry and regulator, leading a $32 billion industry, and skepticism over supplements.
TIME: After three-plus years at the FDA, why did you want to go back to industry?
Fabricant: I think we did more in my three and a half years there than had ever been done in dietary supplements, so I packed a career into a short time. I started to realize there is a lot I can do outside the agency to drive some of the issues I started to deal with inside in the agency, and that we can use the leverage we have to drive those initiatives. I enjoyed the work tremendously, and I am really proud of the work at the agency. This opportunity fell out of the sky, and it wasn’t without a lot of thought, but it’s an organization I really treasure.
TIME: How do you think your experience at FDA influence your new position at the NPA?
Fabricant: I think people look at the relationship between industry and regulator as an adversarial one. Not that it can’t be, but for our industry, the primary function is the same. It’s really about making sure the consumer has access to safe products. The thing we did particularly well when I was at the agency was tie it to public health. That’s big for us at NPA as well, and I think we are really going to have to drive the points home. There needs to be an understanding of why this is so important to the agency, and we need to make communications are crystal clear. In some ways I am lucky that I speak both languages on the industry and regulator side, which I think is becoming more and more important.
TIME: What challenges are you facing as the natural product industry continues to grow?
Fabricant: Culturally, there’s a shift, and there needs to be. The industry grew out of independent health care stores, and still has that independent spirit. At the same time, as things mature and we see natural products spread out to other market places, there may be misinformation or disinformation depending on who you ask. I think it’s about building a community across all chains of distribution throughout the supply chain and making sure everyone is on board with the concepts that got us to this going. The natural movement has gone more mainstream. You go into any store now and you see a lot of natural and organic products that you may not have seen 10-15 years ago. While everyone is excited about the growth in the marketplace, we also want to make sure that information is still out there to help consumers.
TIME: What about all the incidences of products with unclaimed and undisclosed ingredients, and criticisms of poor regulation? What is the NPA’s role in this?
Fabricant: I think one of the biggest things we can do is make sure that the agency is fully funded and the resources are there. Coming out of the FDA, you look at certain structure–and the bureaucracy takes awhile to change–but certain structures are not as appropriate as they used to be to get at the heart of those problems.
One of the concerns we had while I was at the agency, and it is still a concern in the industry, are not supplements at all, but products masquerading as supplements. Tainted products that are typically found in three areas: sexual enhancement, body building, and weight loss. They contain active pharmaceutical ingredients and they are in effect, unapproved new drugs. [These manufacturers] use the supplement rubric as a mask to get at the marketplace. That taints the whole industry.
One thing I got to know at the agency very well is the bandwidth at the FDA and the Dept. of Justice to bring to court those sorts of cases. This is what people are expecting of them. That’s part of our role—to make sure the agency is properly funded and also really adequately aligned with those interests. I don’t think that’s a tough sell.
TIME: There’s also a lot of skepticism over whether Americans really need to be taking supplements at all. How do you respond to that?
Fabricant: I think it’s interesting. I think physicians by and large only get on average about 16 hours worth of nutritional education in the medical school curriculum. Sixteen hours isn’t a lot, and I think less of that is dedicated to supplements and studies on supplements. I think it’s a community we really need to address, and make sure they understand the issues. One of the first things we tell anyone when they ask what we tell our retailers and manufacturers to advise consumers, is always talk to your doctor. But I think one of the things we need to do is make sure the docs are educated as well and really have a clear grasp of what’s what. A lot of people tend to have a strong opinion on dietary supplements on one way or the other. I think taking the emotion out of the topic and just looking at the science and is the place we would like to get things to.
TIME: What supplements do you take on a daily basis?
Fabricant: I take a multivitamin, I take fish oil, and I take a probiotic.
TIME: People are very interested in probiotics. How do you determine what to take?
Fabricant: There’s a lot out there. Talk to your physician and look at the research. I take it as general support for GI health and digestion, and I like the way mine tastes—it’s a liquid product. But if you go to clinicaltrials.gov there’s research on those sorts of products that support GI health. There’s a lot of information out there. They key question with any supplement use is why. When it comes to things like multivitamins, I take a multivitamin because I don’t necessarily always have the time to eat the best, so I want to make sure I am at least getting those things we know we need. It’s not so easy to get fatty fish in the diet, so I take fish oil.
TIME: What are you looking forward to as the natural product industry continues to grow?
Fabricant: The conversations. Getting people together who were not speaking as readily in the past. This industry has more in common than it does separate. I want to get people talking.",What supplements does Dan Fabricant take on a daily basis?,"Dan Fabricant takes a multivitamin, fish oil, and a probiotic on a daily basis."
"Hello there! Welcome to my travel blog, Nomadilogue, a renewed attempt at documenting and recollecting my backpacking adventures and misadventures on a budget. Yes, I am a self-confessed cheapskate (kuripot) traveler who enjoys the nomadic way of life. I believe that traveling can be enjoyable even with little money in your pocket.
In the coming blog entries, you will read my stories, adventures, mishaps, advice and tips on traveling on the cheap, recommendations on places to visit, where to stay, where to eat, what public transportation to take, et cetera. Everything that you will read here is entirely based on my own first-hand experience, unless otherwise stated. I will also be reposting my old travel-related articles from my now-defunct personal blog which I created way back in 2007. So my posts will not be arranged in chronological order in terms of the travel date, but I will be creating several categories to organize the content.
Although this blog primarily aims to inspire my readers from the Philippines to get out of their comfort zone through traveling, I will try to write stuff that will speak to an international audience. Hopefully, you will find the content posted here helpful in planning your future travels.
I promise myself to update this blog regularly and I plan to keep the promise of being prolific than ever before. Feel free to follow my blog and share your own travel experiences by commenting in my posts.

"Topic: CHMOD Newbie Craze
I have noticed alot of users (and I mean alot) think that CHMOD is always the answer, in fact not even 1% (maybe 2%
) of all problems can be resolved by CHMOD, let's take a minute to find out wat CHMOD is and what it does...
Firstly, all it does is tell what users can access files, it doesn't control code, so changing CHMOD will not make an error message dissapear, nor will it allow certains options to appear.
It is not related to PHP directly, they can 'communicate' but not in a conventional sense
Here is a problem that cannot be resolved by CHMOD:
Warning: main(X): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /www/site/folder on line #
Whereas this can:
Warning: fopen(X): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /www/site/folder on line #
So before posting answers such as:
Have you CHMOD the file?
Think how does it affect the problem in anyway due to permissions",What does CHMOD do and what kind of problems can it resolve?,"CHMOD tells what users can access files.

"When thinking of the composition of his roster, Rangers coach Alain Vigneault reiterated throughout training camp that “money will be a factor.”
In the hard-salary-cap world of the NHL, is has to be, especially for a big-market team like the Rangers with big-money contracts already on the books. But now that the preseason schedule has concluded and the next game is the regular-season opener Thursday night at the Garden against the Islanders, the Rangers are hoping to obtain something they so rarely have had in the recent past: roster flexibility.
The current group of 24 players on the books does include forward Oscar Lindberg, still on injured reserve. It leaves the Rangers with just over $2 million in space under the $73 million salary-cap ceiling. The amount of money they are under the cap each day accrues, so a penny saved today is one that can be used tomorrow — or at the Feb. 28 trade deadline.
“We’re definitely under the cap, but any more that we spend on a player not playing, we can use later on,” Vigneault said after Saturday’s practice at Chelsea Piers, having given his players off Sunday before returning Monday for three days of practice leading into the season opener.
“I’m looking at the big picture,” Vigneault added. “That’s what I’m talking about.”
The Blueshirts have $47.825 million annually locked up in eight players — Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello, Marc Staal, Dan Girardi, Ryan McDonagh and Henrik Lundqvist. (And imagine if captain McDonagh wasn’t signed for such a club-friendly $4.7 million per season?) So eight players make up about 68 percent of the club’s salary, and the other 15 players make up the remaining 32 percent. The lopsided nature is true on almost all NHL teams, leaving an onus on young, relatively cheap players to contribute in big roles.
So as much as Vigneault’s ideal world contains a group with eight defensemen and 13 forwards, he knows it might not be the best scenario. If new defensemen Nick Holden and Adam Clendening are both scratched for the opener — which it seems they will be, barring a swing in opinion over the next few days of practice — they are still counting against the cap without playing. The decision then has to be made whether they’re worth keeping around to not play while losing future cap flexibility.
Clendening would have to clear waivers to be sent down to AHL Hartford, while waiving Holden would likely mean the Rangers would lose him for nothing. Yet if 22-year-old Brady Skjei struggles early on, it might not be a short leash or short patience that gets him sent down without waivers, but the cap implications.
The biggest difference from years past is the level of uncertainty that remains with what the Rangers have. They don’t know what to expect from Girardi coming off an awful season, preceded by so many good ones. Staal had a good camp, but is he back to being the aggressive and stout defenseman the team so desperately needs?
There is youth up front in Jimmy Vesey, Pavel Buchnevich and Mika Zibanejad, but how consistent can they be in carrying the offensive weight? Can Brandon Pirri keep scoring like he did in preseason, can Michael Grabner stay healthy and actually help the penalty kill, and can Josh Jooris be a steadying fourth-line center?
There are so many questions that can’t be answered yet, and it does very little good to try to guess what will happen. Instead, Vigneault and the front office are waiting with somewhat bated breath to see exactly what they have.
“I’m thinking that we might, for a short amount of time, until we sort things out, see different players in NHL competition. We might keep 23,” Vigneault said. “But I’m not 100 percent sure yet.”
He’s not 100 percent sure because it’s unknown just what kind of team the Rangers are right now. And when they find out, they want the financial ability to be able to change on the fly.","What is the total annual salary of the eight players Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello, Marc Staal, Dan Girardi, Ryan McDonagh and Henrik Lundqvist in the Rangers team?","The total annual salary of the eight players Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello, Marc Staal, Dan Girardi, Ryan McDonagh and Henrik Lundqvist in the Rangers team is $47.825 million."
"Is the art world too sensitive to see itself in the corrosively shiny veneer of reality television? To hear artists and art critics kvetch on blogs, in the arts press and at art openings, it appears Bravo’s new series, ""Work of Art: America’s Next Great Artist,"" is ruffling feathers.
""Just watched 1st epi of bravo's 'work of art.' truly terrible,"" wrote an artist friend in her Facebook post. ""What's with all the painters? and since when did 'i can't sell this' become a valid critique?"" Jenn Graves, art critic for Seattle’s Stranger, emphatically concurred: ""The show was horrible. Really, truly awful. Critic Jerry Saltz was the biggest disappointment for me: Is it the editing, or does he really believe that the mission statement of art is, 'Art is a way of showing the outside world what your inside world is like.' So is vomiting."" ""The overall quality of artist-crew is at best uneven,"" writes Regina Hackett in ArtsJournal. Even one of the show's judges, the aforementioned Jerry Saltz, noted his ambivalence in a New York magazine blog posting: ""Art on TV and in movies always comes off creepy.""
Contemporary art has never quite jibed with mainstream media. Art, it seems, gets close to the mainstream only when it combines big money and pop iconography — Damien Hirst, Banksy, Jeff Koons, or the perennial Andy Warhol, who famously cameo-ed on ""The Love Boat."" But the show has somehow recruited major auction house kingpin Simon de Pury as the mentor figure, and persuaded the venerable Brooklyn Museum to host a solo show of the winning artist (a longtime museum trustee resigned in protest against the Bravo partnership). Both are participating in the show despite the risk of being called ""sellouts,"" one of the art world's biggest insults.
Part of the reason art so rarely flourishes on TV is that most artists are reluctant to be represented in the mainstream media. Just hearing people on television discuss ""the work"" in art-world lingo, makes us art-world denizens shudder: In the context of highly formatted cable entertainment, it sounds put on and pretentious. The judges on ""Work of Art,"" for example, look for art that makes them ""feel"" (""Your art didn’t make us feel anything” being one of host China Chow’s steely dismissal lines), and then there are the clownish, obviously expensive designer clothes they wear to their so-called crits. It's enough to make you wonder why artists would want to participate (the casting calls attracted hundreds of hopefuls).
Nao Bustamante, a contestant who works primarily in performance and is in the first episode relegated to the egotistical villain role, admitted in a recent interview that her participation came with artistic intent. ""I went on as a narrative experiment,"" she told me, meaning to upset the standard narrative of an artist’s career. One thing you don’t learn on the show is that an art career currently adheres to a chronology: first an MFA, then gallery representation, a string of exhibitions (and maybe sales), a teaching job, a museum retrospective and death (which increases the value of the artwork).
""I wanted to shake up that model, make it uncomfortable,"" Bustamante said. It’s an artistically honorable sentiment, though it’s fairly clear that her attempts at challenging the system didn't always survive the harsh editing of reality TV. (True to form, ""Work of Art"" includes archetypal characters familiar to anyone who frequents gallery openings — though ""curated"" for catty drama potential, leaving out the eggheads and socially awkward artists.)
""Work of Art"" attempts to offer an intimate view of the place where artistic creation happens, but it doesn't quite pull that off, in part because it sticks faithfully to the reality TV structure. Like other shows in the genre, the producers make contestants jump through hoops, in accelerated time frames, to make stuff — a format that has very little to do with real-world creative activities. Artists are as likely to make a portrait in nine hours as a chef combining Cheetos and balsamic is likely to make a great meal. In episode 3, the contestants created book covers, a challenge that ignores the distinctions between fine and commercial art. It's no wonder the results weren't very good.
That said, the show does seem to be getting better,?
To cross over into pop culture, we need art icons who can flourish in public, the way Marina Abramovic — an artist whose power and charisma courts and can withstand the glare of the media lights — did with her MOMA retrospective. Is it any wonder that Jeff Koons, whose work is all about pop sentiment, was the only artist to be mentioned by name — twice — in the premiere? ""Work of Art’s"" $100,000 prize wouldn’t even qualify as a down payment on one of his million-dollar sculptures, but it is a modest price to pay to put working artists, semi-realistically, on the cultural radar. For that, I plan to keep watching.

"Dublin | 20 April 2012
The Minister for Children Frances Fitzgerald launched Ireland’s first National Poisons Awareness Day.
Developed by the National Poisons Information Centre at Beaumont Hospital, the day is intended to increase awareness of the dangers of poisons, especially to very young children, of the steps to take to avoid those dangers and what to do if someone has taken something which could be poisonous.
To mark the day the Minister was presented with a storybook, “Say NO to Poisons!”, when she attended Early Childhood Ireland’s conference in Dublin. The book has been developed by the National Poisons Information Centre at Beaumont Hospital with the assistance and support of the staff and children of County Carlow VEC Childcare Centre, the Health Service Executive and Early Childhood Ireland.
The book is one element in a learning and teaching resource being made available to daycare centres and preschools throughout Ireland. It is attractively illustrated by Louise Osborne.
Speaking at the launch NPIC Director Dr. Edel Duggan said that every year the Centre received over 4,000 enquiries concerning young children who had been involved in a poisoning incident.
“Our aim,” she said, “is to educate young children about potential poisons both inside and outside the home, and to help them understand that they should always ask an adult if something is safe to eat or drink.”
Dr Duggan said many people had been involved in developing the new education resource, including Martina Osborne of County Carlow VEC’s Adult and Further Education Office and Nicola Cassidy of the NPIC, who had instigated and driven the project.
As part of its national awareness day NPIC is also keen to ensure that parents and all those with responsibility for looking after children know exactly what to do if they suspect an incident has occurred.
“A quick phone call to our information centre will ensure swift access to the information required. Very often a child will not need to visit a hospital or doctor and we can provide reassurance. But where urgent action is required we can give that information too,” Dr Duggan said. “We would urge everyone to store our number in their phone – 01 809 2166. The line is open from 8 am in the morning to 10 pm at night, seven days a week.”
Fiona McDonnell, HSE Early Years Service said reducing risk of harm from accidental injury was a major area of focus within child health services. The HSE was delighted to support this initiative, she said. “We hope that children, parents and care workers will all benefit from the health education messages provided as part of this programme.
Early Childhood Ireland’s CEO, Irene Gunning, emphasised that young children are naturally curious and could inhale or swallow
poisonous substances without realising the danger. “This can be anything from household detergents to prescribed medicine, which in a child’s mind could be colourful sweets or goodies,” she said.
“The safety of children in our care is top of the agenda for our members and we are happy to do our bit by spreading the word through this story book and by giving the “Say No to Poisons” campaign a platform at our conference. Following simple basic safety rules will help encourage a reduction in the numbers of young children ingesting harmful or poisonous substances, which would be a positive outcome all round.”

My Miles wears contacts but if I could afford it I would consider getting him lasered (that sounds sort of naughty... hmmmm) instead of having to deal w/ contacts daily. We've had our share of lost, damaged, down the drain ones, tho its a relief from glasses (and much more attractive) I, sigh, should have some, tho its not imperative. I won't run anyone off the road, but I should have some for distance for driving. And I have a drugstore pair for reading if I want to hold a magazine right in front of my retinas... I usually read at arm's length anyrate.
Thx for your encouraging visits, always. They uplift me.

"A Sheffield charity which supports children with Encephalitis has won Sainsbury’s Sheffield’s prestigious Charity of the Year accolade – and will celebrate its new partnership by staging a number of fundraising events.
The Eden Dora Trust was set up two years ago by a Sheffield mum named Petrina after her six-year-old daughter Eden became seriously ill with Encephalitis.
Encephalitis is a potentially deadly brain inflammation, which can occur at any time. It can leave a child with life-changing brain injuries and disabilities.
The first of these fundraising events is an awareness day at Sainsbury’s Sheffield’s Archer Road store, consisting of volunteers and supporters of the Eden Dora Trust helping customers to pack their shopping bags whilst raising awareness of childhood Encephalitis. This will take place this coming weekend (Friday 30 September and Saturday 1 October 2016).
The aim of the charity is to help make life better and easier for children and their families and carers affected through support, information, research and rehabilitation.
The Eden Dora Trust is the only charity in the UK dedicated solely to children who suffer from Encephalitis. Charity patrons include Louis Tomlinson, Paul Dickov, Joe Hart and Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff.
Petrina said: “We were very honoured and excited to be chosen as Sainsbury’s charity partner of the year, and we are really looking forward to working together with Sainsbury’s.
“Community is at the heart of everything we do as a charity so to be involved with such a community-focused organisation in a city as friendly and supportive as Sheffield is without doubt a huge boost.
“Eden was very lucky to survive Encephalitis, when so many other children do not. There was nowhere near enough support available, and we knew that we needed to help others. We were adamant that other families and carers were not to go through this devastating illness alone, like we had to.
“Vital funds raised from events such as those on Friday and Saturday will help pioneering research into the causes, diagnoses and treatments of this debilitating illness, produce educational literature, and provide training for families, teachers and health care professionals involved with the ongoing care and rehabilitation affected by this life-changing illness.
“If anyone can spare any time at all to help, whether that’s an hour or two, or the whole day, that would be be amazing. Children are welcome too.”
Further events that the Eden Dora Trust and Sainsbury’s have organised together are:
- A fashion show in Sainsbury’s Archer Road store on Thursday 8 November, 7pm. (contact the Eden Dora Trust for tickets)
- A Christmas Awareness weekend at Sainsbury’s Archer Road store on 2, 3 and 4 December.
The Eden Dora Trust also has places available for the Sheffield Half Marathon – contact the team to secure a place.

"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Despite its reputation as one of the noisiest and most difficult places for opposing quarterbacks to play, Tom Brady says he's excited to travel to CenturyLink Field in Seattle for a Week 6 matchup with the Seahawks.
""I think anytime you go on the road, you expect it to be loud,"" the Patriots quarterback told reporters during a Wednesday news conference. ""We practice with that. I know this is a very -- [the stadium] gets some attention around the league for how loud it is. I'm actually excited to get out there and play in a place I've never played.""
Seattle is one of just two cities that Brady has not played in during his 12-plus seasons in the NFL (San Francisco being the other), and the quarterback admits he's excited to take the field at a new venue.
""Yeah, I think I've always looked forward to doing that,"" Brady said. ""There probably aren't many that I haven't played in at this point. But this will be fun. It's always nice when you take 53 guys on the road and you say, 'This is all we've got and this is all we need and this is what we have to do.' ""
Among the goals for Brady and his offense will be to quiet the crowd, and, as he states, turn the fans against their own team.
""I think that's an exciting part for road teams, is to see if you can get them booing their own players,"" he said.
It won't be easy to do, as Seattle boasts one of the top defenses in the league, and, according to head coach Bill Belichick, the loudest stadium.
""We've played in a lot of loud stadiums before, but none louder than Seattle,"" Belichick said. ""I think they're as loud as anybody. We'll have to do a good job with our communication and just our mental alertness.""
Belichick says his team will ""crank up"" the noise at practice this week in an effort to simulate the game conditions, but ultimately it will come down to execution on Sunday.
""We can crank up the noise here as loud as you want to crank it up, [but] in the end, Sunday we're going to have to go out there and we know we're going to have to deal with it,"" he said. ""And it's not just offense, it's your punt protection ... on the field goals, it's all those plays.""
Receiver Deion Branch, who played four-plus seasons with the Seahawks, knows what the Patriots will be facing.
""I think everyone knows the atmosphere of that stadium,"" Branch said. ""Everybody across the league [knows] it's by far the loudest stadium, and it can get louder and things go bad for the offensive side of the ball.""
In order to neutralize the impact of the crowd noise, Branch says, the Patriots must stay focused on what the team can control.
""I think the biggest thing for us is to make sure we go in and stay focused and try to stay on track, and we can try to control that portion of the game,"" Branch continued. ""We just have to go out there and do our job, and we can kind of silence them a little. Just a little.""
Seahawks rookie quarterback Russell Wilson, who played his final college season at the University of Wisconsin (whose Camp Randall Stadium seats north of 80,000 people), describes the atmosphere in Seattle as unique.
""There is nothing like it,"" Wilson said. ""I played in a lot of stadiums in college, in front of 100,000 people, and here I'm not sure exactly what it is -- probably 65, 66,000 -- but it's ferocious in that stadium, just how loud it is, and the energy that the 12th Man fans bring in CenturyLink. Just that energy, that passion that our fans bring, it really heightens our ability to play at an even higher level.""
The veteran Brady says there's nothing better than taking an opposing crowd out of the game with a strong performance, as his team was able to do in Buffalo during Week 4.
""That's the fun part about being on the road. There's nothing better than being on the road, like in Buffalo a few weeks ago, there were more of our fans there at the end than their fans,"" he continued. ""We've done that in Pittsburgh, we've done that in some very loud environments.""
Last Sunday at Gillette, during the Patriots' Week 5 victory over the Denver Broncos, Brady and his offense spent the majority of the game running an up-tempo, fast-paced attack. But in Seattle, in front of a spirited crowd and ambient noise, will that approach work?
Brady says the offense can play at a number of different tempos, and will focus on what it believes to be the most effective strategy to attack the opposition.
""I think we have several different tempos that we try to play at. Sometimes you go no-huddle; sometimes we have to slow it down,"" he said. ""It's all really a matter of how the game is going and how we feel is the best way to attack the other team.
""Every week you go in and you have different modes of playing and plays and schemes, and usually by halftime you narrow those down and you have 30, 35 plays left in the game and those are the ones you have to hone in on,"" Brady said. ""Whatever is working, that's what we're going to try to do.""
Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, who compared the Patriots' offense to the University of Oregon's (which Carroll faced annually during his tenure as the head coach at USC), says that practicing fast is the goal of his defense's preparation this week. He also mentioned getting lined up fast and displaying sound technique as integral to slowing down the Patriots' up-tempo pace.
""It's the problem of getting everyone where they have to go and doing the things you have to do. That's the challenge to it,"" he said. ""If we line up, and get our assignments right, and play well techniquewise, we'll have a chance to show you what we're all about. If not, then we'll look like the other teams they're playing and they'll have their way.""",Which two cities has Tom Brady not played in during his 12-plus seasons in the NFL?,Seattle and San Francisco are the two cities that Tom Brady has not played in during his 12-plus seasons in the NFL.

"A new friend of mine just texted me to say ""Do you know Jessie J, musical artiste? Vulgar gal rap."" Naturally, I want to know about all things musically new that I haven't heard before, especially when it involves a woman breaking down the barriers of femininity that society places on them.
Last night I had a conversation with someone about the concept of ""post-feminism"" and how I grew up as one of the guys and never thought of myself as a woman/girl held back by the constraints of society. Both my mom and dad worked, and that was never weird at home. My mom also cooked, and that was just what it was. I was always expected to do as well as the guys, if not better (because my parents would tell me that I was THE BEST). Even as the smallest one in my social group (of more guys than girls), it was never assumed that I couldn't do something because I was a girl... it wasn't even assumed that I couldn't reach things that were high up since I was always climbing on stuff like a monkey. Basically, me and my female friends grew up as dudes with slits and that was the ONLY difference (particularly since I didn’t grow boobs until I was about 18).
So the verb ""banging"" comes into play. It means ""to bang"" as in ""to have intercourse."" I was asked ""Can a girl bang a guy?"" I say yes. I say that if the girl is telling a story about having ""intercourse"" with a guy, then she can say ""i banged that dude."" Similarly, a guy can say ""i banged that girl,"" or a person might be able to say ""we banged."" It puts the power into the hands of the story teller, which, in my mind, neutralizes gender roles. It's not necessarily a bad thing if a person says they banged another person, but it’s slightly less vulgar than to say “fucked” and a lot less awkward than saying “had intercourse with,” or “made love to,” or “railed.”
Anyway, I am a fan of this Jessie J character’s song “Do It Like a Dude,” for this precise reason. She wants to bang and is unapologetic about that. She also c0-wrote Miley Cyrus' ""Party in the U.S.A."" with Dr. Luke, so I love her for that alone. God Bless!

"Hey beauties,
For the last year, I have been going to Danish classes about 4 times a week. Most of the time I resented it and couldn’t be happier for the day I’d be done with language school. But now I’m almost done and I feel like I’m not ready to be “released” into Danish society just yet.
In Denmark there are 3 language levels (for those that only went to elementary school, high school, or have an academic background) and I’m placed in the group with an academic background where the full education will lead up to level B2. So for most of last year, I have been in different classes with like-minded people and a lot of them I call my friends.
While I was allowed to skip the first module pretty much on the basis of speaking Dutch, it still took me a year to finish module 2 til 5 (which I considering long, but it’s actually a lot shorter than the 3 years the government reserves for us). I never allowed myself to take any breaks, not even during summer. My dad learned Dutch in about 2/3 years and my mom, well lets just say that she “knows” Dutch and they did this all under the pressure of a 60 hour a week job. So I was (and still am) determined to get a hold on this language.
Most of the time though, I didn’t really felt that my Danish was improving at all and in my mind I always made the next module the benchmark of being fluent: while being in module 3, I’d say “when I’m in module 4, I’ll be fluent” and while being in module 4, I’d say the same about module 5. I’d always feel intimidated by those darn Germans, because somehow they were always fluent as soon as they just walked into the class room. And over the year, I’ve received a lot of feedback (or critique) from my teachers on my writing assignment. But honestly, who wants to write a 200 words essay about the Danish healthcare system?
So now I’ve finished the first half of the final exam (level B2) and I just received the below messaged from the language school:
First of all, I have to start with the Danish grading scale, it might be the weirdest system world-wide. The lowest grade is a -3, passing is 02 and 12 is the highest grade. While I was kinda aiming for “passing”, so it all would be done, I surprised myself with a 12 (A or 10/10) for reading and a 10 for writing (B or 9/10). While I received these fantastic grades, I still feel my Danish isn’t wat it is supposed to be. Of course, at this point I’m able to go see a doctor in Danish, order a beer at the bar or even do some small talking. But I definitely feel that I’m not completely able yet to let my personality shine through in Danish and I easily get caught of guard when people speak Danish to me. In 2 weeks I will have my (final) oral exam and if I pass this I will finally done: but do I really want to be done?
I’m really hard for myself and while most people are satisfied with the regular “Danskuddannelse”, I’m still not content with my Danish these days. If I manage to graduate with a 10 on average, it’s possible to apply for “Studieprøve”: a Danish education, which leads to level C1. With this diploma you’re allowed to study at a Danish taught education (not that I’m interested in that), but it gives me some more time to develop my Danish skill further. So even though, I have shouted for the last year that I wanted Danish to be over I have to withdraw my words.
Have you ever tried to learn a new language and has it been as frustrating as Danish has been for me?
With love,
-Janet

het klinkt heel lastig, goed dat je toch gewoon doorgaat! de aanhouder wint zullen we maar zeggen :)!
Dankje babe! En het einde is gelukkig in zicht 😀
hi! i’m just a randomer passing by, but you really sound like you’re very hard on yourself. i’m studying to be a sign language interpreter, and while i’m in my fourth year of uni i still don’t feel entirely comfortable and fluent in sign language (which was an entirely new language to me). i have to practise every day or i lose it, and i have to repeat lots. learning a new language isn’t easy (as you clearly know), and i think you can give yourself some credit for doing well, and be a little kinder to yourself. i’d say, don’t compare yourself to anyone else and take it at your own pace, seems like you’re working hard enough. i’m sure you’ll get there and good luck!
Hi Sabienne,
Thank you for your sweet and encouraging comment! I know I should be more chilled about this new language and trust that, with time, it all will come. But it’s hard (as you might know) to stay positive, when you’re frustrated when things don’t run smoothly. I think it’s amazing that you’re studying sigh language and can’t even imagine how hard that must be. Good luck with your journey!
PS: I loved your comment about not comparing myself with others, sometimes I forget that at the end of the day we all are different. Some do learn a new language within a sneeze and me, well apparently I need some time.. But it’s okay, at least I can bake a killer apple pie..

"After the League Championship Series Spring Split playoffs, Team SoloMid had announced that they will be holding tryouts for a new support player following Bora “YellOwStaR” Kim’s departure from the team.
The news was published on TSM’s official website, citing that YellOwstaR had expressed his desire to make a return to Europe, despite leading his team to the North American LCS finals.
TSM will be holding tryouts to find the right man to take his place, as they had not decided on a replacement for the French support. He has also not revealed any team that he will be joining in the EU region.
“After the Spring Split playoffs, our support Bora ‘YellOwStaR’ Kim has expressed a desire to return to Europe for the remainder of the season. As such we are announcing open tryouts for the Support position on our League of Legends roster,” the announcement read.
“We are seeking the best possible player across all regions to fill his spot on the team. We would prefer a player with fluency in English. If interested, reach out to your team owners to help coordinate a tryout with us,” it added.
Since his time with Fnatic in 2015, Kim came to be recognized as one of the best team captains in League of Legends in the western regions.
More than just a leader, Kim went well beyond leading his team as he rebuilt the organization’s entire roster which then went ahead to win the LCS two consecutive times and secure a place at the 2015 League of Legends World Championship semifinals.
However, it appeared that he struggled following his transition to the North American region and TSM, as the team did not perform as well as many hoped.
They had a roller coaster of a season, falling short time and time again even as everyone favored the team in the tournament.
But even with such setbacks, the team managed to pull through into the playoffs and eliminated Cloud 9 and regular splits Immortals, before they stop short and lost to Counter Logic Gaming in a thrilling final.
There are no obvious replacements for Kim as of yet, but given the fact that teams usually release players in-between LCS splits the open spot won’t stay that way for long. TSM had followed suit, revealing in the announcement that they are open for negotiations for Kim’s expired contract.",Why did Bora “YellOwStaR” Kim leave Team SoloMid?,Bora “YellOwStaR” Kim left Team SoloMid because he expressed a desire to return to Europe for the remainder of the season.
"Economist David Rosenberg believes the bond market is getting inflation right and yields shouldn’t trade at higher levels.
His reasoning: Inflation as a temporary phenomenon caused by enormous pent-up demand and supply chain issues connected to the coronavirus pandemic.
“The numbers have been shocking to the upside, no doubt about it. But it’s pretty easily explainable,” the Rosenberg Research president told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “I don’t understand why people want to superimpose these last couple of months into the future.”
So far, the bond market is shrugging off inflation. The benchmark 10-year Treasury Note yield hit its lowest level since March 3 on Friday and closed at 1.45%. The yield is off 7% over the last week and down almost 11% over the past month.
Sliding yields have been on Rosenberg’s radar for months.
In late February on “Trading Nation,” Rosenberg called the bond market “radically oversold” and predicted the 10-year yield would retreat to 1%. At the time, the yield was around 1.5%.
“There is just so much noise and distortion in the data,” said Rosenberg, who served as Merrill Lynch’s top North American economist from 2002 to 2009. “The most dangerous thing anybody can do is extrapolate what’s happening now.”
“I refuse to hyperventilate over inflation.”
David Rosenberg
In a note to investors on Friday, he wrote “I refuse to hyperventilate over inflation.” He believes the other side of surging growth is a plateau.
“That’s the story for the second half of the year… The bond market is sniffing that out right now,” Rosenberg said. “My forecast is slower growth, inflation peaking out and rolling over and a bull flattening in the yield curve.”
It’s an outlook that would spell trouble for the reopening trade. Rosenberg predicts consumer cyclicals, a major part of it, will fall out of favor later this year.
“Growth should reclaim leadership over value in the stock market,” he said. “You want to be more in defensive growth and in areas of the market that are going to benefit from a lower bond yield.”
Rosenberg may be expecting trouble for the reopening trade, but he also believes bitcoin is prime for a resurgence. The cryptocurrency has been getting walloped, down 38% over the past two months.
He also wrote on Friday about encouraging signs that show bitcoin is getting ready for “another shot upwards.” He further suggested technicals indicate overbought conditions are unwinding.
Yet, he still won’t completely embrace the asset.
“I don’t own bitcoin. I never recommended anybody to buy it. It seems to me that crypto is here to stay. There is no doubt about it as a facilitator, of a medium of exchange,” he said. “Bitcoin, to me, is a speculative trade. I don’t see it as a bonafide investment.”
Rosenberg prefers gold, an asset he has owned for years.
“I just say buy the gold,” Rosenberg said. “Gold has 1/5 of the volatility that bitcoin has.”
Gold is up 8% over the past two months. However, it’s off about one percent so far this year.",What is David Rosenberg's view on the current inflation situation and its impact on the bond market?,"David Rosenberg believes that the current inflation is a temporary phenomenon caused by enormous pent-up demand and supply chain issues connected to the coronavirus pandemic.

"Elected Public Officials Issue Neuropathy Awareness Week Proclamations
May 13, 2013
Since the launch of The Neuropathy Association’s campaign in March 2013 aimed at getting the community to request Neuropathy Awareness Week proclamations from elected public officials and raising neuropathy’s profile while also encouraging the media to focus on neuropathy, several proclamations have been issued by:
NEUROPATHY AWARENESS WEEK PROCLAMATION TOOLKIT
- Sample proclamation for Neuropathy Awareness Week; - Sample letter requesting a proclamation from your elected public official; and- Sample press release for proclamation.
Support Your #1 Cause: The Fight Against Neuropathy!
- Tampa (FL) Mayor Bob Buckhorn, at the urging of our Tampa-based neuropathy support group;
- Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, at the urging of Martin Dempsey (a member in our community);
- Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, at the urging of Andy Hyland (with our Kansas University Neuropathy Center of Excellence);
- Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, at the urging of support group leader Leslie MacGregor Levine;
- Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, at the urging of Julia Martin (a Las Vegas-based member in our community);
- West Caldwell (NJ) Mayor Joseph Tempesta, at the urging of support group leader Mary Robertson;
- Texas Governor Rick Perry, at the urging of support group leader Bill Thomas;
- Rhode Island Governor Lincoln D. Chafee, at the urging of Mr. Paul Maziarz (a member in our community);
- West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, at the urging of Jerry Mays (a Martinsburg-based member in our community).
While we were unable to get a proclamation issued by New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, we did receive a mayoral message.
Getting a proclamation for neuropathy with the help of our elected public officials is a great way to raise neuropathy’s profile in your community. It is also a great opportunity to encourage the media to focus on this disabling neurological disease affecting over 20,000,000 people across the U.S.
So, how do you go about requesting a proclamation? Issuing a proclamation is a straightforward process, and most elected officials are happy to accommodate their constituents’ requests. Whether individually or through your local neuropathy support group, you can follow these steps to get a proclamation issued at the state or local level:
Step 1: Research the proclamation process in your state or local community
Whether at the state or in your local community, it is important to start researching and working towards getting a neuropathy proclamation issued. Investigate the process to request a proclamation; some government websites have a proclamation request form that you can submit electronically. You can also call your governor’s or mayor’s office to learn about the procedure for having a proclamation issued. Be sure to also ask if there was a neuropathy proclamation issued in previous years that you can re-submit (several of our neuropathy support group and chapter leaders have submitted proclamations in the past).
Step 2: Contact your public officials
Now that you have identified the point of contact at your governor’s or mayor’s or state senator’s office and have reviewed the procedure for making a proclamation request, you can customize the following samples:
- Sample proclamation for Neuropathy Awareness Week; and
- Sample letter requesting a proclamation from your elected public official.
Step 3: Follow up
Be sure to follow-up with your public official’s office by phone a week after you submit your proclamation request. You can also offer to meet with them to answer any of their questions and request their timeline on the proclamation request, emphasizing Neuropathy Awareness Week’s relevance for you and the more than 20,000,000 Americans battling neuropathy.
Step 4: Publicize the proclamation
With the proclamation issued, publicizing it is a great way to raise awareness for neuropathy in your community. You can customize the following press release sample and share it with local media representatives at television, newspaper, and radio stations. Be sure to include:
1). why the proclamation was issued and who issued it;
2). information about The Neuropathy Association;
3). some factoids about neuropathy and why it’s critical to raise awareness of neuropathy; and
4). a quote from the government official signing the proclamation, from The Neuropathy Association, and/or from people affected by neuropathy in your community.
- Sample press release for proclamation
If you plan to present the signed proclamation at a public event, invite the media to report on it. You can also invite public officials to your event and publicly recognize them for their role in issuing the proclamation. Be sure to ask your public officials to display the proclamation in their offices and on their websites. You can also send the proclamation to all your personal contacts and social media groups, explaining why this proclamation is important to you and millions battling neuropathy. In some cases, the public official may have an opportunity to read the proclamation as part of their regular schedule of public events—ask if your local support group can attend to represent the people living with neuropathy.
Step 5: Send a “thank you” note
Be sure to send a “thank you” note to all who helped you issue the proclamation.
Be sure to also let The Neuropathy Association know about the proclamation and share any photo opportunities and press releases from the event so we can share your good news and accomplishments with our greater community.",What is the purpose of requesting Neuropathy Awareness Week proclamations from elected public officials?,"The purpose of requesting Neuropathy Awareness Week proclamations from elected public officials is to raise neuropathy’s profile in the community and encourage the media to focus on this disabling neurological disease affecting over 20,000,000 people across the U.S."

Two recent comments worth bringing to the front page:
First, a couple of links to recent artforum.com articles.
Hello,
I’m writing to point out to you two articles from the February issue of Artforum now online. One offers Yale art historian Sean Keller’s take on the renovations of Mies’s Crown Hall at IIT and Louis Kahn’s Yale University Art Gallery. The other is artist Josiah McElheny’s musings on architect Josef Hoffmann’s interiors, timed to coincide with an exhibition at New York’s Neue Galerie.
I would be flattered if you’d consider linking to either article (or both).

Next, more news on the Human League album cover graphics from Jack at submitresponse.com.
Ah, that’s why they’re familiar! I’d have to dig through a ton of boxes to check, but I seem to remember Pritt Stick-ing a photocopy of that particular dancing couple onto the cover of the master copy of a fanzine about 12 years ago.
It’s a single, rather than an album, though, and there’s two versions of the sleeve - the original 1978 issue on Fast has more architectural illustrations on the back, along with lyrics, the 1982 Virgin/EMI just has the songs listed on the back. (I know this because I really want a first pressing 1978 copy, the one in mono with black and white labels, but only have a French 1982 reissue, ‘produit et realisé par The Human League’. Sad, eh?)
Found via hockertonhousingproject.org.uk news - Bob the Builder goes green:
Bob the Builder has gone green! Parents of small children watching Bob the Builder episodes this week may have been bemused to see Bob installing an aerial on a yurt, a window in a dome and attending to a problem at the sunflower oil processing plant.
…
It seems that while Bob was building an extension for Mr Adams, a local architect in Bobsville, he heard Adams talking about a competition, which he had entered, to develop Sunflower Valley, a place that Bob used to visit as a child. Fearing Adam’s plan will turn Sunflower Valley into a crowded environmentally unfriendly development that will devastate the countryside; Bob entered the competition himself with a design for a green town intended to complement the local environment.
I’ve yet to see the episode in question and I’m unable to report on how well Bob’s green town performs under other legislation such as Secured by Design, Lifetime Homes, Building for Life, CABE recommendations, Scheme Development Standards, Ecohomes, Code for Sustainable Homes and SAP calculations. However, from what I know from several years of watching Bob’s career develop, it’ll undoubtedly fail miserably unless Wendy steps in and sorts it out.
Back and forth: Owen responds with added detail about some of the recent Letraset people appearances, pointing out that a couple of them once made an appearance on The Human League’s album cover: Being Boiled - Circus of Death.
Where next? Does anybody know the source of the other graphic on the album?
And there I was thinking I ruled the roost when it came to sharing architectural images of days gone by. A link by thingsmagazine.net to nastybrutalistandshort caught my eye for another reason when I spotted a Gorden Cullen sketch taken from a book that currently resides on my bedside table*: Homes for Today and Tomorrow (Ministry of Housing, 1961)
Which proved to be only the beginning of a collection of wonderful images from this period posted on Owen Hatherley’s site The Measures Taken. Other examples include the work of Cedric Price, Alison and Peter Smithson and the GLC..

"There’s a profound feeling that shifts us outside the box of the routine and familiar and opens us to something much larger than ourselves writes Homaira Kabir. We’ve all felt it – the goose bumps on our arms when standing below towering Eucalyptus trees or the expansive feeling in our chests when watching the sun slowly set in the horizon.
Researchers define it as the emotion of awe. Like most positive emotions, it boosts physical health and inspires altruistic action. And yet, awe is more – because it recruits both motivations of the paradoxical human brain. It gives rise to a feeling of fear that is initiated in the more primitive parts of the brain. But it also opens us up to belonging to something much larger than the self, the most human of all needs. It is this whole brain functioning that is so essential for optimal performance, both in our personal lives and at work.
The Reality of the 21st Century Workplace
Most workplaces today function on the quick-fix, efficiency model of the industrial revolution that stands in direct contrast to awe-cultivation. It may have worked in an era when workers clocked in the necessary hours in order to live life after work. But in an age of evolving consciousness and where change, uncertainty and competition are the norm, we’re overworked, unhappy, and disengaged. Somewhere on the journey to progress, we seem to have lost our soul.
Why Awe May Be the Answer
Awe jars us out of our usual way of seeing things. But instead of making us resist change, it opens us up to the passing nature of life and to our integral, albeit tiny place in a much larger whole. We see our fragility and vulnerability, which gives us a profound sense of humility. But we also appreciate the vastness of experience, and the desire to leave something of ourselves behind in the world.
What Leaders Can Do to Cultivate It
Employees who are aware of their role in the organisation and driven to do their best to fulfill it are the “awe-struck” ones who can focus on what is important by connecting it to a larger purpose. Even though these capabilities lie in two separate hemispheres in our brains, we as humans are uniquely equipped to harness both at the same time. As leaders, we would do well to nurture this capacity.
- A daily practice of mindfulness develops the awareness to break through the safety of routine and the hammer wheel of emotions in order to experience a much larger sense of being alive.
- A mentor who has the potential to experience both the anxiety and the thrill of extending themselves beyond their comfort zone can help employees discover more of who they are and thus rise to their true potential.
- Visits to museums and operas are great ways to be moved by something powerful. Organisations that encourage employees to get in touch with the wholeness of their being help them bring their full selves to work.
- Organisations that take volunteering and “doing good” seriously answer an inherent human need to find meaning. Employees who can appreciate the positive effect of their work are intrinsically driven to do more.
- Connecting with nature is one of the best ways of belonging to something larger and of being reminded of the impermanence of life. It kindles the responsibility we carry towards it – something that is often forgotten in the daily churn of deadlines.
Tapping into an awe-based consciousness has profound implications for the way we live our lives. Instead of confining it to the spiritual realm, leaders would do well to nurture its daunting and exalting qualities in the workplace. But as Kirk Schneider, author of Awakening to Awe points out, it’s not a tool we can use at will. It’s at best a way of being – perhaps closer to the Taoist concept of wu-wei (pronounced ooo-way) – translated as “trying not to try”.
An enigma as paradoxical as the human brain.

"A FREAK ice storm that created lethal driving conditions led to the death of a driver, an inquest heard.
Aaron Frost, a 25-year-old kitchen fitter, was travelling home from work along the A27 at Emsworth on January 13 this year when he was caught in a hail storm that turned the road into a sheet of ice.
An inquest at Portsmouth Guildhall on Friday heard Aaron lost control of his BMW saloon and crashed into a concrete barrier at the side of the road.
The car then hit a lamppost and overturned before coming to rest on its side in a ditch, close to the onslip at Emsworth, just before the Shell garage.
The inquest heard Aaron was travelling back home to Bognor Regis, having worked in the Petersfield area.
He was chatting on a hands-free mobile phone with his best friend, Jake Gladwin.
In a statement, Jake said he suddenly heard Aaron swear.
He said: “I heard a crash sound. I tried calling for five minutes, but did not get a response.”
Wayne Angus, a lorry driver, said the weather changed very quickly that evening, about 7.50pm.
“The hail was not coming down, it was coming sideways,” he said.
“That’s when everything started to go crazy.”
Several cars and a van on both sides of the road started to skid and spin.
Mr Angus stopped his lorry and spotted the stricken BMW down an embankment.
“The ice on the floor was thick,” he said.
“I nearly fell over. Everyone was skidding.”
Paramedics took Aaron to St Richard’s Hospital, in, recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying Aaron was ‘blameless’ in what happened.
He said: “What happened to Aaron happened in a split second.
“From driving on a perfectly safe road, in a split second, they were all in an extremely dangerous position where we had this flash ice storm.”
After the inquest, Aaron’s aunt Glenna Frost, from Bognor Regis, said: “He was a lovely lad and his family really miss him.
“It’s such a tragic accident. It was just the wrong place at the wrong time.”

"About NICAM
What is NICAM?
NICAM is a Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM), used as a Global Cloud Resolving Model (GCRM). A subkilometer-mesh global simulation is already performed using the K computer by Miyamoto et al. (2013). NICAM is first developed by H.Tomita (JAMSTEC; now at AICS, RIKEN) and M.Satoh (AORI, The Univ. of Tokyo), and is now under development in cooperation with AORI, JAMSTEC, and AICS by the NICAM developers listed at here. Introduction papers of NICAM are Satoh et al. (2014, PEPS), Satoh et al.(2008, J.Comp. Physics), and Tomita and Satoh (2004, Fluid Dyn. Res.).

Experimental Monitoring of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)
For MJO research by NICAM, MJO is monitored every day by two types of MJO index. One is the index by Wheeler and Hendon (2004) produced by Bureau of Meteorology Research Center (Australia) / An All-season Real-time Multivariate MJO Index. The other is an index defined by projection of the band passed-filtered daily anomaly data of velocity potential at 200-hPa (CHI200) in JRA-25/JCDAS produced by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) onto its EOFs. Raw climatology data of CHI200 is made by each daily averaged data from 1 April 1979 to 31 December 2008 and its 60 days low-passed filtered version is used as climatology data. Anomalies dataset of CHI200 from the climatology is bandpass-filtered by 30-90 days. The principal and second modes of empirical orthogonal function (EOFs) of 30-90 days filtered CHI200 anomalies data are used to define the cycle of the MJO. Both of the indices are opened in the page of MJO index.

On the whole, the market is showing a volatile upward trend, the technical side is gradually stabilizing, and the market volume can be released and expanded. With the easing of short-term inflationary pressures, the continuous implementation of policies and the successive admission of new funds, it is expected to boost market confidence. It is expected that the market will be in July. There are still opportunities for shocks to rise.
Guosheng Securities also believes that the current inflationary pressures have eased, the manufacturing industry has been expanding steadily, the job market has continued to improve, and the industry’s prosperity has maintained a relatively high level.

"Hi! I would love to have a travel companion during my adventures. I would like to work with animals during this time but am open to other volunteer opportunities as well. I will be volunteering in exchange for food and accommodation. I am looking to work with animals whether it is a wildlife safari, animal sanctuary, zoo or animal shelter. I am taking almost an entire year off (early September 2017 - late May 2018). I would like to visit multiple countries during this time and am open to anywhere in Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. I am very adventurous and open to new experiences. I love hiking, biking, swimming, backpacking, camping basically anything outdoors. I can also speak German and Spanish if you want to learn a little. I hope we can meet up and travel together. Let me know if you are interested!
Hi.
I’m looking to go travelling from the beginning of November 2017 till late April 2018 so 6 months. I’m open to any destinations as I have not travelled before. Your plans sound pretty amazing and i would be interested in coming along with you if your up for it. Hope to hear back. Nick
It would be awesome to travel together. We can chat more over email and discuss our plans. My email is .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).
Hi Lara!
I’m out there a bit sooner than you are as my visa expires end of August so I have to get my 3 months regional in by then but if you head out any sooner and end up on the east coast give me a shout!
would be great to meet some people to do some active/outdoors stuff with.
I’ll probably miss your time out there as my Oz visa runs out end of August and my 2nd year I might not do until 2018, might end up travelling during September though, maybe New Zealand (probably money-dependent!) before coming home again though so will have to give you guys a shout see where you end up going first
Good luck with the travel plans! x",What are the preferred activities of the person planning to travel?,"The person planning to travel prefers working with animals, hiking, biking, swimming, backpacking, camping and anything outdoors."
"Modest Mouse: Interview
Dead Animals in the Field
In
the song ""Float On,"" the opening lyric is about backing into a parked cop car
that eventually just drives away. It's a nice metaphor for the rise of this
indie-alternative rock band from Washington enjoyed last year, the car being
popular culture and it driving away being that culture telling everyone about
this ""new"" band they just discovered.
Accidentally being famous can be trying for anyone (ask that Steve Bartman kid
from Chicago). But Modest Mouse has been able to float on with their new found
mainstream success, showing no indication that this will go to their head. In
fact, it's possible they are a little oblivious as to how popular they have
become.
Bassist Eric Judy took time out to briefly chat about the rise of Modest Mouse
and about his favorite animal costume.
Your tour recently started. How has it been going?
It's been good. Last night was our first show and it was a bit rough. The
sound just wasn't right so we're gonna try to redeem ourselves with the next
show. We're having a long sound check today.
Congratulations on the two Grammy nominations. What were you doing when you
heard the news?
I don't really remember. I think I might just been home and our manager
called.
Were you surprised at the nomination?
It's really exciting and a once in a lifetime experience. We don't have high
hopes in winning. I really don't expect to win at all. If for some weird reason
we were to win, we'll probably just walk up there and bumble around.
How did it feel last year going from a band few knew about to a band being
played on MTV almost every day?
I don't think any of us were expecting to have that sort of success.
Do you think the two singles were written for the radio or that people's taste
in music changed?
Mainstream music shifts over time. It seemed like last year was truly a year
for more indie rock type bands to have some success.
Does the success add pressure to a future album?
Not for me, though it might be different for the other guys. For me, I feel
the opposite. We've had one really commercially successful album. We can do
whatever the fuck we want. I can brag about that album for the rest of my life.
Has the band written anything new?
No. There were a few songs that were left unfinished that we started recording,
but we don't have any new songs. I think right now with any bit of practice
time, we're trying to bring back older songs. We won't start on new songs till
the summer.
What old songs are you bringing back?
We just started playing ""Dramamine"" again and yester were going over ""Tiny
Cities Made of Ashes."" That one has been rearranged. It's going to be fun. There
are a few others too.
A lot of your songs have pretty ambiguous meanings. Do you ever get tired of
people hounding you about what they mean?
I don't. Issac gets that a lot, so I'm sure he gets tired of that. That's
his department. I kinda have my own little fun when I try to guess at what some
of them mean. But I never ask him. I like figuring out my own meanings.
When did you know you wanted to be in a band?
From the earliest I can remember, I just loved music. When I was a teenager,
I decided to buy a bass because I didn't know anyone else who played a bass. It
just seemed like a neat thing to do. Then I met Issac and Jeremy and that's the
first band I was in. And we're still a band.
What was your favorite Modest Mouse album and why?
The Lonesome Crowded West. That's recently come to me. I've been
listening to that over again over the last few months. I think that's a good
record. Sure it has certain memories with it, but after a certain time, you're
able to have an objective point of view. It's a really weird record and I'm glad
we made it.
How are you handling fame and signing autographs for people?
That's not a new thing with this record, just more of it. I don't freak out
anymore. I sign stuff for people all the time. I got used to doing it. At first
I would be ""Man, that's really weird. Why would you want me to sign something
for you?"" Now I think it's weird if I say no.
Where do the ideas for the music videos come from? Is it the band, is it the
director?
With ""Float On,"" I think that was the director's idea. With ""Oceans,"" it was
a combination of Issac and the director. There was this theme of someone being
dragged around dead. Then it changed to dead animals in the field. I was a
squirrel with a broke arm. I was going to be a badger, but a squirrel was more
believable in terms of being nursed back to health.
Do you guys where those suits during the life show?
No we don't. Those suits were pretty neat though.
I also read you will be at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee this summer.
That's funny. It was one of those things where nobody knew about it. Someone
happened to see it listed and that's how we found out. It was a happy surprise.
I don't even know who else is going to be there.
Drive-by Truckers, Dave Mathews Band, and John Prine to mention a few.
John Prine? I like that guy. This is more exciting now.
One last question. Who would win in a fight? A modest mouse or a mighty mouse.
I just don't know. We have six people, so I would say us. Yea.
We were saying you too, but no one would know because you would be too modest.
Yea, that's right.",What is the favorite Modest Mouse album of bassist Eric Judy and why?,"Eric Judy's favorite Modest Mouse album is The Lonesome Crowded West because he thinks it's a good record and a really weird one, which he's glad they made.

Gary sick did meddle in the manufactured Devolution of 1979. He just has a knack to be wrong about Iran all the time.

""Gary sick ... just has a knack to be wrong about Iran all the time.""
That is so true. I met him in 1985, I asked him why he thought the US media had not said anything about the recent scattered demonstrations that had taken place in Tehran in favor of Bakhtiar (there had been a demo in support of Bakhtiar in Tehran that year whereby a good number of people had turned on their car lights during the day to show their backing). His answer was that he didn't think the Reagan administration would have stopped any such news from being published had they been able to anyway, and that in any case, he didn't think the Regan admin. had any sympathy for the IR, neither were they trying to establish any inroad into the Iranian establishment.
Just a few months later, the whole Iran-Contra affair broke out and it became clear that Robert McFarlane (Reagan's National Security adviser who actually replaced Gary Sick himself at that position after Reagan was elected) had traveled to Iran with presents for the ayatollahs in order to establish a ""connection""!
Sick actually even wrote a book about the whole thing afterwards and became a proponent of establishment of ties between the US and the Islamic Republic thereafter! So indeed, he has practically always been wrong about his very subject matter...
P_J. – An Iranian!
These people, the so called” experts”, are intentionally myopic in order to expand their influence/hegemony throughout the world. Using this gimmickry enables them to rationalize and justify their intended robbery, spearheaded by the so called “experts”.
We saw that in 1953 coup against Mossadegh, and I am sure that some IDIOT(s) like the mentioned duo had advised them, the US government, against having the democratic Iran, and had proposed the establishment of a vicious bloody dictator and the SAVAK as its secret police, or henchman, turning Iran into a police state for the next 24 years, and ransacking our wealth.
That outrages behavior resulted in culminating the roots of hatred and revolution and its reverberation brought us another dark and vicious, this time, group of religious monsters!

Dear Parham: I think the overarching goal of the democratic faction of the CIA/Pentagon/Realists/Hawks, has been to liberalize the secular monarchies in Islamic countries, regardless of Presidents. The policy hopes that the Islamists will learn how to navigate the democratic process without resorting to terrorism. So far, their experiment in Iran has failed and has not produced the results intended either for the US or Iran. However, in the long run, it may prove to be actually the right course for changing these islamist societies from bottom up where the masses realize that Islam or Islamists in power are incapable of governing their country or improving their lives or the lives of their children; as it is happening in Iran right now....just my 2 cents.
amirparvizforsecularmonarchy – I Love Waterfalls and Find One of the most humorous things in the world; is the notion that Americans are a greater force for good & more civilized than Nazi's, Mullahs and Communists.
You are wrong on the USA's aims and the reasons for it. This is how they portray their own actions to deceive the public, the USA's game is to hide their own real agenda so no one can read their hand and they can continue down their path. After seeing your optimistic comment I know for sure you don't see the picture at all from a scientific stand point. If the USA cared for the ground up approach they would be helping that and they are not.
parham
Sure, why not. I don't rally know if that is the case --pertaining to hawks, I think they're more inclined to the ""bombing into democracy"" doctrine-- but I could be wrong.

I meant the hawks in the democratic party and the realists (Gates is one of them) in the Republican party.

"Very often we find ourselves in a situation where the other person’s success means our failure. Their success is a constant reminder on how incapable we are. however, being people that we are, we will act happy for them.
Oh wait! No – we are happy for them, we are just sad for our poor selves who were not able to get that promotion. I will, for now, equate it to jealousy, because it simply means we are envious of the other’s success.
Is it not important to realise that we have worked too hard and we also deserving of the promotion just like the co-worker? We are, sometime, cheated and justice never prevails. We work hard, thinking things will be better this time, but still we find ourselves in the same position.
Maybe we are looking at this whole thing wrongly. How about we do this: We believe in the reality of our dreams. We put sweat and faith together. And as we pray we also participate in making sure that our prayers are a reality.
Maybe that’s what also make us feel stuck – comparison. As we compare our results with the other persons, we are definitely scaling twenty percent of the evidence (which is that we did not get the promotion, or we did not achieve that level of success) This is the only part you really witness.
We are ignoring the eighty percent that happens behind the scenes of the success. We are ignoring the fact that they also worked twice as hard like we did. The thing is we are never sure, we will never be certain of their level of faith, and their sweat and their participation in the reality of their dreams.
Moreover, how about we take lessons? Lessons that whatever is achievable with one man, is achievable with all. How about we acknowledge that there are people who sent to show us that certain barriers can be broken. How about we appreciate and recognise that one’s success is for all. How about we acknowledge that someone sets a bar for us to achieve.
We also say to our daughters:
She is not your rival, she is your sister – a step-ladder.
She is not your enemy, she is your reflection.
Her success does not mean your failure, however it means a glimpse of your ‘beyond’ capabilities – what you cannot see within yourself.",What is the suggested approach to dealing with feelings of jealousy towards a coworker's success?,"The suggested approach is to believe in the reality of our dreams, put sweat and faith together, and participate in making sure that our prayers are a reality.

"A leprechaun for Gabe
March 17, 2004
March 17, 2004
It's St. Patty's day and the kids in Gabe's class had an important project to complete. Gabe failed to catch a leprechaun last year, but he's very determined that this year's trap will be a success. It's a two stage trap. The first stage has a spring-loaded door with a bunch of shiny pennies tempting the little green guy into the trap. Once inside, he'll fall through a hole into a nice little home Gabe created for him. Bright and early, Gabe is ready to check the trap. Unfortunately a very thorough check of every corner of the trap fails to uncover his whereabouts.
Realization of another failure to catch a leprechaun this year sinks in slowly, and then quickly turns into rage and the total destruction of the trap. I might be exaggerating a little.
If we can't catch a leprechaun, at least we can dress up the dog. Oh the inhumanity.",What was the purpose of the two-stage trap that Gabe created?,"The purpose of the two-stage trap that Gabe created was to catch a leprechaun. The first stage had a spring-loaded door with shiny pennies to lure the leprechaun into the trap, and once inside, the leprechaun would fall through a hole into a home Gabe created for him."
"If investors needed to be reminded how important monetary policy is for sharemarkets, then Thursday’s unexpectedly strong employment report was timely.
Shares fell more than 1 per cent and holders of Australian bonds were also blindsided by the highest number of jobs created since November, 2002 as both markets reacted to the idea the official cash rate might not be going any lower.
Indeed, following the massive surge in jobs – total employment rose 71,500 in February, compared with the average forecast of closer to 10,000 – the interest rate market has nearly unwound any sort of rate cut altogether.
The implied cash rate is now 2.90 per cent by November this year when at the start of the year a fall to 2.5 per cent by the end of the year was tipped.
As a result, bond prices sank and yields soared across the spectrum of short and long-dated maturities as bonds extended their recent sell-off that this week pushed the yield on the benchmark three-year bond above the Reserve Bank of Australia’s overnight cash rate, now at 3 per cent, for the first time since July 2011.
But before everyone heads to their mortgage provider to lock in their fixed rate home loan rate, some economists were questioning if the numbers were just too good to be true.
The monthly numbers can always be volatile but should be treated with some suspicion when the swings are that large.
As BT’s Chris Caton points out, about 65 per cent of the jobs created came from part-time males but they make up around 9 per cent of total employment.
“It’s good news; just not as good as it appears at first glance,’’ Caton says.
But the bond market bears won out on Thursday and they are in the all-news-is-good-news phase that leads to higher yields.
Yields, after all, have been rising for the past couple of months, on the back of good economic data – domestic and offshore.
And equity investors don’t seem to be too worried.
Mos appear to be thinking that the rally needed to slow down and some consolidation was overdue.
But in the back of their minds must be the possibility of a more severe sell-off.
According to Goldman Sachs, over the past 12 years the months of March and April have been the trigger point for a correction on Wall Street about 50 per cent of the time.
In 2011 and 2012, stocks peaked in April and March respectively and March also sparked a sell-off in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2005 the broker told clients in a note.
The major bank stocks are most at risk here as they carry the most leverage.
They’ve had a great run but life gets tougher if yields start to rise and stay higher.
If investors continue to get better than expected economic data here and in the United States, then bond yields will keep rising.
And shares, having gained around 30 per cent in nine months, will also start to be a cause for worry about the impact of higher interest rates.
Morgan Stanley’s equity strategist Gerard Minack thinks that central banks have won the battle of sustaining recoveries in the major developed economies by keeping monetary policy but worries they might not win the war.
“Winning the battle isn’t winning the war. If central bankers do win this round, the next downturn could be, in my view, an omnishambles,"" he has told clients.
He worries that, as a result of ultra low interest rates, there has now been a rise in leverage.
That is happening in the US, he says, with aggregate non-financial debt to GDP rising in the December quarter, the first increase in four years.
Another worrying sign for him is the record low yields on junk bonds that implies investors are mispricing risk.
Minack thinks the most important test now for investors is the “ability of the US to cope with fiscal tightening"".
The Australian Financial Review",What was the reaction of the share and bond markets to the unexpectedly strong employment report?,"Shares fell more than 1 per cent and holders of Australian bonds were also blindsided by the highest number of jobs created since November, 2002 as both markets reacted to the idea the official cash rate might not be going any lower."

"ATLANTA — If you are looking for a ""prince,"" scratch Thomas Spravka off your list.
""If I see, `Princess looking for a prince,' I stop right there,"" said Spravka, a member of Yahoo Personals, an online dating site.
ATLANTA — If you are looking for a ""prince,"" scratch Thomas Spravka off your list.
""If I see, `Princess looking for a prince,' I stop right there,"" said Spravka, a member of Yahoo Personals, an online dating site.
An online personal ad declaring, ""I can go from jeans to a black dress,"" won't wow him either.
""I mean, really, who cares?"" said Spravka, a 47-year-old single photographer who wades through cliche-laden personals in his search for The One.
As online dating quickly expands into a modern-day scene that attracts millions of singles, a new cottage industry has sprung up to help those learning the ropes.
For $59.99, you can hire an adviser from PersonalsTrainer.com to do a ""complete tuneup"" of your personal ad. The advisers, who include a former writer from HBO's ""Sex and the City"" and radio relationship therapist Judy Kuriansky, stomp out cliches and spice up generic gab, delivering the redo within three days.
""I think a lot of people are really fabulous as people but are not necessarily as writers,"" said Aury Wallington, the former ""Sex"" writer.
Date.com and 50 other online dating sites have teamed up with 2-year-old ProfileDoctor.com to provide a makeover within 48 hours for $28. Advertising copywriter Brian Hicks runs the weeklyscore.com dating-advice site for men, under the name Jack Conway. E-cyrano.com offers online-dating coaching sessions. And in Atlanta, Michael Law of theprofileproject.com owns a business devoted to snapping pictures for online personals aimed at giving singles a more polished and glam look. Photo shoots start at $100.
Picking the right photo
""I am big into the online dating thing -- and I noticed there weren't a lot of good photos. They were blurry [and had] bad lighting,"" said 35-year-old Law. ""And [singles] don't pick good photos of themselves. Men are famous for not picking appropriate photos. They will pick a photo of themselves at a wedding because they think they look good -- but then it looks like it's a photo of them at their own wedding.""
Last year, Americans spent $396 million on online personals, according to Jupiter Research. By 2009, Americans are expected to dole out $623 million per year on online personals. Rewriting gurus claim they can improve someone's number of responses in the face of increasing competition. Online dating sites list millions of single people from around the world. Match.com displays more than 100,000 singles from Atlanta alone.
""People want to show range, but you know what? That tells you nothing,"" said David Evans, 35, who launched ProfileDoctor.com about two years ago.
Rewriters suggest being specific -- mention your favorite food or restaurant, your favorite TV program, details that provide a larger window into your personality. In Evans' own online profile, he calls himself, a ""Jetta-driving Democrat who likes NPR.""
Big turnoffs
A March 2003 Match survey of single people found they were turned off by two particular mistakes: talk about ex-mates, and poor spelling and grammar. Other common flaws include negative comments and revealing too much personal information or writing about risky topics, such as sex.
Mary White, a member of Match.com, won't dawdle on any profile that includes a photograph of a man without a shirt or any profile with grammatical errors.
But White admits to having to make changes to her own online profile. She got rid of ""I hate sports"" and now says, ""The Braves and Falcons are fun to watch, but only live.""
Since then, the number of men writing to her is way up -- as many as five a day.
Kathleen Irby, a 34-year-old Atlanta single, approaches her online personal as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Does she exercise? Nope. Her daily diet? Junk food junkie. And her favorite thing to do? Eat peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon.
In less than two weeks, her Match.com profile has been beeping with more than 100 flirty e-mails coming her way.
""And so many people bring up the peanut butter,"" she said. ""And no, I didn't say I travel like everyone else. I've been to Portugal once. That doesn't mean that I travel.""
She also knows the online photo helps.
Michael Lasky, co-author of ""Online Dating for Dummies,"" also believes a good photograph can go a long way.
""Spending 50 to 75 bucks on a photo is a good investment,"" Lasky said.
Lasky recommends singles ask a friend or someone of the opposite sex to critique their online personal.
Spravka changed his user name in the headline thomasseat25a to ""Happiness within the Journey.""
He is also open to refining his personal but won't be paying for any help.
""I think it's a rip-off,"" he said.
And Irby plans on keeping hers just the way it is.
""I know it sounds smart [alecky] but at least it sounds like me,"" she said.",What are some of the services offered by online dating profile improvement businesses?,"Some of the services offered by online dating profile improvement businesses include a ""complete tuneup"" of your personal ad by advisers from PersonalsTrainer.com, a makeover within 48 hours for $28 by ProfileDoctor.com, online-dating coaching sessions by E-cyrano.com, and photo shoots starting at $100 by theprofileproject.com to give singles a more polished and glam look."
"Climate: Rich nations have dodged finance pledge
PARIS: A hundred billion dollars every year –- that with tensions, experts say.
- The Context -
The vow to gradually ramp up aid for the Global South to $100 billion (86.5 billion euros) per year by 2020 was first made at the 2009 UN climate summit in Copenhagen.
A decade later, wealthy nations were still far from the mark, with the total below $80 billion in 2019, according to the OECD, which took on the role of tracking climate finance.
If only outright grants and not loans are considered, the amount drops by almost half, say NGOs that monitor money flows.
With a Democrat back in the White House, the US has doubled its aid and promises $11.4 billion per year by 2024, but it's still not enough to close the gap. Canada and Germany are expected to announce enhanced commitments before the Glasgow summit opens on October 31.
China may be the world's top carbon polluter today, accounting for more than a quarter of global emissions, but the United States and other rich countries are historically the main emitters of greenhouse gases.
COP26 host Boris Johnson recently reminded leaders at the UN that Britain had pioneered the industrial revolution and was the first country ""to send enough acrid smoke into the atmosphere to disrupt the natural order"".
""We understand that when developing countries look to us for help, we have to shoulder our responsibilities,"" the British Prime Minister continued.
- Stakes high -
One of the biggest challenges facing climate negotiations is a deficit of trust among parties, and climate finance may be the most fraught issue on the table.
""The shortfall in funds is costing lives and livelihoods,"" Sonam Wangi, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) negotiating bloc, said in a statement.
""Developed countries delivering on their decade-old commitment to support vulnerable countries ... will be critical for building trust and accelerating the global response to climate change.""
UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa agrees that living up to those promises could be a key for unlocking other logjams.
""The complexity of the outcome of COP26 is that it is not one or two or three decisions, it has to be a package,"" she told journalists.
""If we can get a good perspective regarding the $100 billion, that would ... give us the means to make progress on some other issues.""
- $100bn not a ceiling -
In 2009, $100 billion sounded like a lot of money, but the recent crescendo of heatwaves, flooding caused by extreme rainfall, drought and evermore powerful storms has made it clear that it's not nearly enough, experts agree.
The sum seems especially paltry compared to the multi-trillion dollar Covid recovery packages that have been cobbled together to prop up rich economies.
""A combined global fiscal response to the crisis of close to $12 trillion begs a question,"" climate finance experts commissioned by the UN wrote in a recent report.
""If a pandemic can provoke such a rapid and far-reaching response, at scale, surely the world can muster the necessary will to act with similar decisiveness and urgency in response to the climate crisis?""
""The $100 billion target therefore needs to be seen as a floor and not as a ceiling,"" the added.
Former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed, representing the Climate Vulnerable Forum of 48 countries home to a billion people, said financing should be broadened to include sovereign debt relief.
""We are so threatened that we might not have an island or a country much longer, so it's hardly possible for us to pay the debt if we are not around,"" he said.
""Is it not then reasonable for climate vulnerable countries to call upon debt holders to restructure their debt?"", he added, saying he would be taking this proposal to the Glasgow talks.
- Symbols of justice -
The $100 billion figure -- earmarked for emissions reduction and preparing for future climate impact -- has become a symbol of the perceived need for ""climate justice"", many observers point out.
The failure of rich nations to honour their pledge is especially galling in light of a separate track in the negotiations over ""loss and damage"", meant to cover the costs of climate-enhanced damages that have already occurred.
""The people and communities the least responsible for the rise in global emissions are facing the worst of the climate crisis right now,"" said Vanessa Nakate, a young climate activist from Uganda.",What was the initial pledge made by rich nations at the 2009 UN climate summit in Copenhagen?,The initial pledge made by rich nations at the 2009 UN climate summit in Copenhagen was to gradually ramp up aid for the Global South to $100 billion per year by 2020.

"Sieve Working Group K. Murchison Internet-Draft Carnegie Mellon University Obsoletes: 3598 (if approved) June 15, 2006 Expires: December 17, 2006 Sieve Email Filtering -- Subaddress Extension draft-ietf-sieve-rfc3598bis 1. Introduction Subaddressing is the practice of augmenting the local-part of an [RFC2822] address with some 'detail' information in order to give some extra meaning to that address. One common way of encoding 'detail' information into the local-part is to add a 'separator character sequence', such as ""+"", to form a boundary between the 'user' (original local-part) and 'detail' sub-parts of the address, much like the ""@"" character forms the boundary between the local-part and domain. Typical uses of subaddressing might be: o A message addressed to ""ken+sieve@example.org"" is delivered into a mailbox called ""sieve"" belonging to the user ""ken"". o A message addressed to ""5551212#123@example.com"" is delivered to the voice mailbox number ""123"" at phone number ""5551212"". This document describes an extension to the Sieve language defined by  4. Subaddress Comparisons Test commands that act exclusively on addresses may take the optional tagged arguments "":user"" and "":detail"" to specify what sub-part of the local-part of the address will be acted upon. NOTE: In most cases, the envelope ""to"" address is the preferred address to examine for subaddress information when the desire is to sort messages based on how they were addressed so as to get to a specific recipient. The envelope address is, after all, the reason a given message is being processed by a given sieve script for a given user. This is particularly true when mailing lists, aliases, and 'virtual domains' are involved since the envelope may be the only source of detail information for the specific recipient. NOTE: Because the encoding of detailed addresses are site and/or implementation specific, using the subaddress extension on foreign addresses (such as the envelope ""from"" address or originator header fields) may lead to inconsistent or incorrect results. The "":user"" argument specifies the user sub-part of the local-part of an address. If the address is not encoded to contain a detail sub- part, then "":user"" specifies the entire left-side of the address (equivalent to "":localpart""). The "":detail"" argument specifies the detail sub-part of the local- part of an address. If the address is not encoded to contain a detail sub-part, then the test evaluates to false. If a zero-length string is encoded as the detail sub-part, then "":detail"" resolves to the empty value (""""). NOTE: If the encoding method used for detailed addresses utilizes a separator character sequence, and the separator character sequence occurs more than once in the local-part, then the logic used to split the address is implementation defined, and is usually dependent on the format used by the encompassing mail system. Implementations MUST make sure that the encoding method used for detailed addresses matches that which is used and/or allowed by the encompassing mail system, otherwise unexpected results might occur. Note that the mechanisms used to define and/or query the encoding method used by the mail system are outside the scope of this document. The "":user"" and "":detail"" address parts are subject to the same rules and restrictions as the standard address parts defined in  [""subaddress"", ""fileinto""]; # In this example the same user account receives mail for both # ""ken@example.com"" and ""postmaster@example.com"" # File all messages to postmaster into a single mailbox, # ignoring the :detail part. if envelope :user ""to"" ""postmaster"" { fileinto ""inbox.postmaster""; stop; } # File mailing list messages (subscribed as ""ken+mta-filters""). if envelope :detail ""to"" ""mta-filters"" { fileinto ""inbox.ietf-mta-filters""; } # Redirect all mail sent to ""ken+foo"". if envelope :detail ""to"" ""foo"" { redirect ""ken@example.net""; } Murchison Appendix A.

All I have to do is think of this one
song by the great (if somewhat obscure) songster Hirth Martinez, ""It's Winter
Again"" and, well, it's like my personal psychic air-conditioning. I don't mind
the heat so much.
And warm thanks to everyone who sent
along comments of concern and condolence and support in regards to the passing
of our friend and brother, Ed Smith. He touched a great many people in his time
of life and for that we are all grateful. An E-special thanks to Ranger
Kidwell-Ross for hosting a fine fare-thee-well gathering at RangervilleUSA, a
perfect location for such an emotional outburst of loss, love, and life-goes-on
affirmation. None of it is taken lightly, but we can now laugh about some of

"It’s almost impossible to get away from politics these days. Hate him, love him or somehow merely tolerate him, but Donald Trump polarizes even the fiction we read.
Or sometimes we read polarized politics into our fiction.
Eugene Weekly recently talked to two local authors who come from different political backgrounds and who were not directly addressing Trump in their books but in whose works current politics still resonate.
Debra Gwartney, in her memoir I Am a Stranger Here Myself, writes a combination of history and memoir. Gwartney has a launch party for her book March 17 in Eugene.
Stranger melds Gwartney’s memories of her childhood in the small town of Salmon and in Boise, Idaho with the real-world tale of Narcissa Whitman, a white woman settler who was killed by the Native Americans she was attempting to convert to Christianity. For Oregon Trail lovers, Whitman was the first white woman documented to have crossed the Rockies.
“I found her intriguing as a negative character,” Gwartney tells EW, “feeling unsettled about my own history in the West.”
But later, as she researched Whitman, who was a missionary, she came to see her as a real person.
“I disagree with so much of what she did.” But she says, Whitman was a pawn, pushed by her mother and the church “with no way to understand what she was getting into.”
As a result, the book reflects not only Gwartney’s feelings of loving Idaho but also her feeling that she didn’t fit in there either. In a family that hunted — claiming to fame being part of the killing of Idaho’s last wolves before they were reintroduced — she’s left-leaning and has never fired a weapon. Stranger also contains a sense of the modern-day ambiguous feeling of loving the West but seeing ourselves as interlopers.
Gwartney says she didn’t name Trump in the book, as the memoir dwells on family dynamics, not politics, but she and her father had clashed about Obama in the past and now politics are even more polarized.
“Is there any common ground?” she wonders, “a way for us to stand together and remember what we love and our common experiences?”
When asked about the rawness of writing about one’s own family, Gwartney says, “My code is, if I am going to write about my family and they are going to be characters in my book then I will be hardest on myself, and hold my own feet to the fire.”
Meanwhile, longtime Republican politician Jack Roberts dropped by EW’s offices to discuss his own work of fiction — a collection of short stories published through Amazon.com called Miracle at Pebble Beach and Other Stories.
Roberts, a former Lane County commissioner and former commissioner of the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, is not doing any local events, but interest in the book was recently piqued when he posted about it on social media.
Roberts says his short stories were written before Trump was elected, but, like Gwartney’s work, the book has echoes of the current political situation and unrest. The title story features a golfer who wins the U.S. Open, but his win is challenged after he thanks Jesus for his club selection — unauthorized assistance? So argues an anti-religion group, but the story, Roberts says is not about religion, it’s about integrity.
Roberts’ writing has a deftness honed by his time writing columns for The Oregonian and a flair for an unforeseen ending — Twilight Zone-esque, he says himself.
The other three stories in the volume are more overtly political, featuring a senator running for re-election but dealing with an anger problem, a plague in Africa that leads to the U.S. president walking, and faltering, on a line between safety and racism, and a tale of a Republican African-American man eyeing a run for president — based not on Obama, Roberts says, but former Secretary of State Colin Powell.
Despite the political nature of the topics and Roberts’ own stance as a moderate Republican, the volume stays away from the ideological narrowness Roberts says he seeks to avoid.
Roberts has considered expanding the last story into a novel, but has mainly concentrated on short stories, writing for his own satisfaction. Years ago, he says, he sent a short story to The Paris Review, and it was rejected. But he was told the publication was interested in his writing and would like to see more.
“Well, that’s the best I’ll ever get,” he told himself.
To read Miracle at Pebble Beach, find it independently published and available for $3.99 at Amazon.com. Debra Gwartney’s I Am a Stranger Here Myself was published in March 2019 by New Mexico Press. A book launch is 4 pm, Sunday, March 17, at the Mahonia Building, 120 Shelton McMurphey Boulevard.

"This Christmas and New Years, my plans involved driving thousands of miles to visit family. Because of this, I thought it would be a good time to give Audible.com a try. If you are unfamiliar with Audible, they are an Amazon company that specializes in audio books. I signed up for a 30 day free trial that included two free downloads and promptly pulled down Michael Lewis’ book titled ‘The Big Short’ that detailed the financial crisis in the subprime mortgage lending business. I chose this title because I liked reading ‘Moneyball’ so I thought this would be an equally interesting read/listen. It was a good book, but it was about as interesting as the financial crises can be, which is not very. I was looking for a more moving experience.
I had always known about the book ‘Ball Four’, but beyond knowing the author’s name and that it was regarded as the best baseball book ever written, I couldn’t tell you anything about it. After listening to an episode of the great podcast ‘Gleeman and the Geek’ (see), co-host Aaron mentioned if he could download any book to listen to off Audible.com, it would probably be ‘Ball Four’. This was enough for me to give it a try.
After pulling the book down on my Samsung Galaxy S III using the Audible.com app, I was stunned to see the book came in at a whopping 18 hours and 32 mins. I figured it was probably a mistake and dove right in. The book itself is narrated by Jim Bouton himself which adds to the charm. The emotion he reads with makes the listener feel like they’re reliving the moments while they were happening.
The book itself is a diary of Jim Bouton’s experiences during the 1969 season with the newly formed Seattle Pilots (the only team in the modern history of Major League Baseball to go bankrupt) and his subsequent trade to the Houston Astros. After finishing the main book, it is no wonder this was selected by the New York Public Library as one of the “Books of the Century.” The stories in the book are both hilarious and genuine.
What made the audio book amazing was what came after the reading of ‘Ball Four’. Every 10 years after the initial publishing, Jim wrote a follow-up (starting with the aptly titled ‘Ball Five’). These chronicled not only what had happened to Bouton over the previous 10 years, but updates on a lot of the ballplayers in the original book and commentary on the state of the game. Jim offered insightful comments on Pete Rose being banned from baseball (he thinks a gambling addiction is no worse than a drug addition and it’s hypocritical of baseball picks and chooses which addictions to punish rather than focus on the disease of addiction), Bouton’s being blacklisted from Old Timer’s Day from the Yankee’s and how he co-founded Big League Chew. In one of the final updates, Jim details any parents worst nightmare… the night he and his wife received a phone call that his daughter Laurie had been in a bad car accident and was in a coma. As a listener, hearing him talk about that night and losing his youngest child made not only the author tear up, but it got a little dusty in the car. His voice quivered and my eyes watered. I never expected to be so moved from what I thought would be a baseball book.
In the end, this book wasn’t about baseball, but rather a remarkable group of people living their dreams in an extraordinary time period and about perseverance and hard work. At the end of the book, I fondly look back at my baseball memories and the great friends I made playing baseball and can’t help but be thankful that Audible and Jim Bouton came together.

"In brief
Claim
The top 1% of earners in the UK are paying 28% of the tax burden.
Conclusion
This isn’t correct. The highest earning 1% in the UK pay an estimated 28% of all income tax – not the total “tax burden”. This is close to a record level, but it isn’t quite the highest percentage ever.
. This is close to a record level, but it isn’t quite the highest percentage ever – the top 1% paid an estimated 29% in 2015/16.
There aren’t any readily available figures for what proportion of all taxes the top 1% pays. Information is available on how much income tax the top 1% of earners pay from HM Revenue and Customs, but only stretching back to 1999.
The top 1% are paying a greater share of total income tax
The top 1% are projected to pay about 28% of income tax in 2017/18, so Theresa May’s claim would be roughly correct if talking just about this. The same figures though show top earners paid slightly more in 2015/16, at about 29% of income taxes. So it’s not correct to say this is a record percentage, in any case.
The last few years have still seen a high proportion of income taxes paid by the top 1%, by historical standards. Since 1999 the percentage the top 1% of earners pay in income tax has risen in an almost consistent trend, across Labour, Coalition, and Conservative Governments. Back at the turn of the century they paid 21%.
During this same period, the percentage of income tax paid by the bottom 50% of earners has fallen from almost 12.6% to just fewer than 10%. The top 50% of earners make up roughly 90% of income tax receipts, slightly more than back in 2000.
Income tax is only a part of the government’s total tax take
Income tax is only a fraction of the total tax take. Over three-quarters of the Government’s income comes from other taxes. So Theresa May’s claim is incorrect when considering all government taxes.
There are direct taxes, such as Council Tax, and National Insurance contributions. There are also indirect taxes, such as VAT, Tobacco and Alcohol Duty, and Corporation Tax.
It is much more difficult to say what percentage of these other taxes the top 1% of earners pay. Households earning the top 10% of incomes pay about 27% in total of most direct and indirect taxes, according to Office of National Statistics (ONS) data. This figure has remained roughly constant since 2009/10.
These numbers at least indicate that the top 1% of households would be paying a smaller fraction of total taxes than 27%, so Mrs May’s claim is unlikely to be correct for the government’s total tax take.

"Mattias Ekholm happy to still be with Predators after trade speculation, and they feel the same | Estes
Hockey can be beautiful in times – and via players – you wouldn’t expect.
I'm talking about a stunningly graceful sequence of only a few seconds: A flicked pass to ignite a give-and-go behind the defense, gliding free on a breakaway, sizzling a shot into the far post and into the net.
Imposing 6-foot-4, 215-pound defensemen with thick beards and hard stares aren’t supposed to do that.
Mattias Ekholm reminded everyone that he can.
His first goal in more than a month made a marvelous moment in Monday night’s pivotal 5-2 victory at a lively Bridgestone Arena, allowing the Nashville Predators to keep distance over the Chicago Blackhawks in the race for the Central Division’s final playoff spot.
Nearly as memorable as the goal itself was the celebration. Ryan Johansen, the teammate on the other end of the give-and-go, caught Ekholm and put his arm around him. The two long-time Preds embraced while skating together about a third of the way down the ice rink.
What isn’t being said specifically, one can infer. Namely, these Preds sure are glad to still have Ekholm in Nashville.
The skill Ekholm flashed Mondayis why so many other NHL teams were interested in him leading up to last week’s trade deadline.
One of the defining storylines of this season will be something that never happened. The Preds caught fire at the right time to avoid hanging the “For Sale” sign that many believed they would.
How close the Preds actually got to trading Ekholm remains unclear. Sure was speculated about, though, more so than for any other Preds player. TSN in Canada listed Ekholm atop its “Trade Bait” list for a while. As recently as March 26, ESPN called Ekholm “the belle of the trade deadline ball among defensemen” and noted that “Teams have been lining up for weeks to land Ekholm if the Predators deal him.”
MORE:How Nashville Predators veered from path toward rebuild to become hottest team in NHL
Insider Pierre LeBrun of TSN reported the Preds’ asking price for Ekholm was a first-round pick, a top prospect and some type of additional, third asset.
There was no ignoring this chatter. Ekholm noticed it just like anyone would.
“It’s nothing that I’ve really had to deal with a lot throughout my career,” he said Monday. “But when the team doesn’t do well and we don’t meet the expectations, things are going to happen. Now we were able to find a way to turn this around, and I’m really happy to be part of that. Because I’ve loved my time in Nashville.”
It was a compliment, really. Ekholm, at age 30, was so coveted because he fell into that sweet spot of a good player with a relatively inexpensive contract. He would have been an ideal addition for multiple contending teams, and those teams knew it.
It was also a helpless situation for Ekholm, too, because the better he played, the more that value would increase. And he was playing awfully well, even when the Preds were not. One could make a case that – outside of thriving goaltender Juuse Saros – Ekholm has been the Preds’ most valuable player this season.
His plus-minus total of +12 – meaning goals scored or allowed while he was on the ice – leads the team. It far exceeds defensemen Ryan Ellis (-6) and Roman Josi (-10).
Entering Monday’s game, Hockey Reference had Ekholm second only to Saros in “overall point shares” on the team. Can't say I'm entirely sure what that means, but it sounds good.

Off the ice, too, coaches have been imploring Ekholm – a stoic, cerebral sort – to be more vocal. And he has done that, becoming an inspirational leader behind a turnaround that has happened despite injuries to key players.
“He’s a really sharp kid,” said Preds coach John Hynes of Ekholm. “Just to see him be able to get out of his shell a little bit vocally … it’s nice when you have a player of his caliber really invested in the team but also coming out of his shell and being vocal, because his voice does have some weight in the room.”
For Ekholm, it looks like he doesn't need to pack. The storm of uncertainty seems to have passed.
General manager David Poile has suggested that Ekholm isn’t going anywhere. For what it’s worth, Poile has grumbled about the extent of the trade speculation this season, especially in Canadian media and especially as it related to Ekholm.
Poile is rarely plainspoken publicly about such matters, but he was when asked about Ekholm on deadline day.
“His name got thrown out there a lot in trade baits and different things,” Poile said. “But I mean, my next conversation with Mattias will be after this year about how he thinks he fits into the future of this hockey club and whether he would like to be here longer, not whether we want to trade him.”

"Psalm 55:22 is a popular Bible verse from a prayer written by King David when he had been betrayed by his close friend. David pours out the cries of his heart to the Lord in Psalm 55. He was hurt and angry, and his prayer shows it.Though David was a man of war and accustomed to fighting, this particular fight was one that cut him to the quick. It wasn’t an enemy who had betrayed him; it was a close friend.
Most of us have felt betrayed at some point in our lives, whether it was a friend, a relative or someone else very close to us. The pain of betrayal is what David was facing, but a burden can be anything that weighs us down.
The word “burden” is defined like this: 1) anything that is carried 2) heavy load, as of work, care or duty 3) to put a burden on; oppress.
We are people and imperfect creatures. Even as Christians with the Holy Spirit living inside us, we fail at times. And others fail us. That’s why mercy and forgiveness are so important.
Though Jesus told us we would have tribulation in the world, He encouraged us with these words in John 16:33.
“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”
Jesus overcame the world by forgiving us all. He went to the cross to protect and defend us from His Father’s wrath and punishment for sin. The cross is a bold declaration of His intense love and mercy toward us.
But even if we have followed His example and forgiven those who weigh us down, the pain of injustice can still be a heavy burden upon us. David understood this and said in Psalm 55:22,
Cast
your burden on the Lord,
And He shall sustain you;
He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.
The Hebrew meanings of “cast” are: throw out, down or away, hurl, pluck, throw.Let’s not allow the burden stick to us. We must deliberately take it from our heart and throw it out. We must place it at the cross, where Jesus died to receive it from us.
Jesus told us that His burden is light (Matthew 11:30). He said He would give us rest (Matthew 11:28). Let’s take Him up on that promise, and cast our cares at His feet. Like a loyal Friend, He wants rest and peace for us even in the midst of a storm.
Psalm 55:22 also says He will sustain us, which in Hebrew means: keep in, abide, comprehend, contain, feed, guide, hold, nourish, receive and make provision.
When we are free from the weight of the burden, we can feel and receive His abiding Presence, protection and provision; we can enjoy every meaning of the word, sustain when we are out from under the burden.
The last promise in Psalm 55:22 says, “He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.” “Moved” in Hebrew means: waver, slip, shake or fall; be out of course, be fallen in decay.
We can confidently claim this promise and live in strength, victory and vitality if we believe that we are the righteous He is talking about here. But, if we have doubt about who we are in Christ even though we are covered by the blood of Jesus Christ, then we can flounder around in a confused fog of doubt and unbelief, heavily burdened by many things.
Even though He has promised us many great things in the Bible, we must participate in the giving process by receiving the gift. If we don’t believe, we probably won’t receive.
It is faith that makes us well. Jesus said it many times.
He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.
Ask for help believing. Ask for help casting your burdens. Ask for help receiving. Reach out to Him for help, and He will sustain you. Study the Bible verse of Psalm 55:22, practice casting your burden upon the Lord and enjoy victory and freedom.",What is the main message of Psalm 55:22 according to King David's prayer?,"The main message of Psalm 55:22 according to King David's prayer is to cast your burdens on the Lord, and He will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved. This implies that one should give their troubles to God, and He will provide support and stability."
"The United States on Monday crossed the staggering milestone of 500,000 COVID-19 deaths just over a 12 months because the coronavirus pandemic claimed its first recognized victim in Santa Clara County, California. Before this incident, it was not clear whether or not the virus could be transmitted via stable organ transplants, although it’s nicely documented with other respiratory viruses. Donor transmission of H1N pandemic influenza has been detected almost completely in lung transplant recipients, Kaul noted. While the Michigan case marks the primary confirmed incident in the U.S. of transmission by way of a transplant, others have been suspected. The transplant recipient deteriorated rapidly, creating multisystem organ failure. Doctors tried identified remedies for Covid-19, including remdesivir, a newly accredited drug, and convalescent blood plasma from folks previously infected with the illness. Eventually, she was positioned on the last-resort option of ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, to no avail.

One Week Into Distribution, Pharmacies Have A Familiar Request: ‘we Simply Need Extra Vaccines’
MNT reports on a webinar with a panel of consultants who discuss methods in which the healthcare in the United States may be reformed and improved during and after COVID-19. Overall, viral transmissions from organ donors to recipients stay rare, occurring in fewer than 1 p.c of transplant recipients, research shows.
Ten other members of the transplant team tested adverse for the virus. The virus was transmitted when lungs from a woman from the Upper Midwest, who died after struggling a severe brain damage in a automobile accident, had been transplanted into a girl with continual obstructive lung illness at University Hospital in Ann Arbor. The nostril and throat samples routinely collected from both organ donors and recipients examined negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

The medical risks dealing with ailing patients who reject a donor organ are usually far greater, stated Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer with the United Network for Organ Sharing, the federal contractor that runs the OPTN. Organ donors have been examined routinely for SARS-CoV-2 in the course of the pandemic, although it’s not required by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, or OPTN, which oversees transplants in the U.S. But the Michigan case underscores the need for more extensive sampling earlier than transplant, especially in areas with excessive rates of Covid-19 transmission, Kaul said. But docs had kept a pattern of fluid washed from deep throughout the donor lungs. When they tested that fluid, it was constructive for the virus. Four days after the transplant, the surgeon who dealt with the donor lungs and performed the surgery tested constructive, too. Genetic screening revealed that the transplant recipient and the surgeon had been infected by the donor.
Life assist was withdrawn, and she died 61 days after the transplant. The United States must proceed to ramp up surveillance efforts designed to spot new variants of the coronavirus in order to comprise the pandemic, consultants said Thursday.

He was a syndicated columnist who wrote a column that was carried by the Washington Post for years called the ""Real Estate Mailbag"".
I know very little about Real Estate but when I started searching for my very first home about 5 years ago I started paying attention to his column. He was sort of the ""Dear Abby of Real Estate"". People would write him with very specific questions about home buying and he'd basically teach fundamentals. He wrote very plainly and knowledgeably and I must admit that I looked forward to reading his column long after I bought my house.
You see, there is some part of my character or personality that really, really admires excellence. When I was a kid even though I didn't really like certain sports or performances, whenever I had the chance to see someone do anything--act, sing, write, serve a volleyball, walk on a balance beam--if they were really excellent I was always thrilled and enchanted. That may be part of the reason that the people I love most in my life (such as my best friends and most certainly my wife) are really excellent at what they do. I'm just awed by people who make what would be for me, difficult things, look so easy I guess
There are a lot of people out there like Robert Bruss. And I hope that I can do a better job in my life of giving credit where credit is due before it's too late. Rest in Peace Mr. Bruss. You helped me and a lot of other people figure out what seemed unfigureoutable. Thanks. -Monica",Who was Robert Bruss and what was his contribution?,"Robert Bruss was a syndicated columnist who wrote a column called the ""Real Estate Mailbag"" for the Washington Post.

Fight Back Against Winter - How to Support an Older Parent When It's Cold Outside
by Brandee Cowley, RN BSN, Apostolic Christian Skylines Home Care Services
Winter can be a dangerous time for older adults, especially those who live alone. Cold weather, slippery walking and driving conditions, shorter days, seasonal influenza, isolation from family and friends, and seasonal depression combine to make winter a challenging time for seniors, especially those living an independent lifestyle. It’s a time when family members need to play a role in ensuring the safety, health and welfare of an older parent.
Reduced hours of daylight contribute to increasing isolation for an independent senior. Many older drivers are not able to drive after sundown or prefer not to. Earlier sunset—as early as 4:40 in Peoria—means that participating in early evening activities becomes a problem. Even during daylight hours, roads can be unpredictably icy and snow-covered. Shopping for essentials such as groceries may suffer, potentially leading to malnutrition and weight loss.
Winter is also flu season. Concern about contracting seasonal influenza can cause a reluctance to go out in public to the shopping mall, the grocery store or even the local donut shop.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons, can cause feelings of moodiness and depression in the winter. Other signs of SAD include changes in appetite or weight, problems with sleeping, low energy, and difficulty concentrating. Symptoms may appear in the late fall or early winter and usually go away during the sunnier spring and summer seasons.
The importance of having the home heating and cooling system in good working order increases in the winter. A malfunctioning furnace can release carbon monoxide into indoor air and cause illness and even death. To save money, some older adults turn down the thermostat to save money on the heating bill. However, the National Institutes of Health says that hypothermia is a danger for vulnerable older adults because their bodies cannot withstand the cold as long as younger people. Cold indoor temperatures can even increase the risk of falls: a European study found that as little as 45 minutes of exposure to chilly indoor temperatures can impact walking ability.
How to Fight Back
Some things you can do to make winter safer, healthier, and more enjoyable for an older family member include:
- Drop in occasionally. Observe. Is the home warm enough? Is the refrigerator well stocked? Are the walks and entry ways free of ice and snow? Are there any changes in your parent’s mood and disposition?
- If they live nearby, host dinner once a week, either “carry in” to your parent’s home or in your home (you provide transportation). If you have siblings or other relatives who are able, take turns hosting. Sharing meals builds bonds; you may even be creating a family tradition.
- Arrange for snow shoveling and salting of all exterior walkways.
- When the weather is bad, offer to escort your family member to church services and activities. Church attendance is important to many seniors and missing services and friends may increase feeling of isolation.
- Head off malnutrition. Offer to accompany on trips to the grocery store and other shopping. Online grocery ordering and home delivery are becoming increasingly available. Offer to help with ordering and have the groceries delivered.
- Watch for signs and symptoms of SAD. While it is normal to have some “down days,” if you see changes in sleeping patterns and appetite, increased alcohol consumption or feelings of hopelessness, their health care provider should be consulted.
- Vitamin D can replace some of the sunshine lost in the winter. Consult with their health care provider for the correct dosage.
- Make sure the heating system is safe. Have it checked before every heating season by a professional to be sure it is ready for winter. Make sure there are carbon monoxide and smoke detectors installed in the home and change the batteries annually.
- Consider purchasing or leasing a personal emergency response system equipped with fall detection. A mobile system will provide 24 hour coverage nearly everywhere.
- Get an annual flu immunization shot, if possible with the high-dose vaccine, which is formulated for seniors. Because the vaccine does not cover all possible strains of influenza, continue to be alert for signs and symptoms of flu.
- If circumstances prevent your direct involvement in the day-to-day life of your parent, consider hiring a licensed home care agency for the winter. A caregiver can provide local transportation to shopping and medical appointments, plan and prepare meals to ensure diet is healthy, and make sure the home is comfortable and safe.

"“Theniel 36:25-27
Sometime back I read a fascinating account of a person who received a heart transplant, and who during his recovery found that his tastes for food had changed. It so happened he was in contact with the donor’s family, and after talking with them, found that he had acquired certain proclivities for food that had been dominant in the donor.
Until it has happened to you, it is impossible to know how it is to be changed by God, to be transformed, to have your sinful nature replaced by one of righteousness and holiness. When the Holy Ghost comes into a person and dwells there, a distinct and dynamic change in direction occurs. You have charted a new course, your vision is lifted, your spirited eyes gaze upward, you’re connected to a new world. Your interest in worldly parties wanes, gambling tables lose their fascination, to drink yourself into oblivion appears foolish and inane. You have become a new person; the spirit of God—that holy and righteous nature—has now infiltrated you. Think it not strange that godly desires and passions claw at you, that His Word and His people become precious and dear.
Relationships with people will deepen, you recognize anew your family to be priceless, and you cherish them and tend them, and think of the destination of their souls. With all wisdom and tenderness you point your loved ones to heaven.
How blessed are you—how blessed am I—we who have experienced the metamorphosis that comes from a spiritual heart transplantation. God’s spirit has entered us, His statues have become our daily directives, His holiness and righteousness have become our compass, His judgments our own.

Amen! It’s a truly wonderful thing to have Dr. Jesus perform spiritual heart surgery on you. It really does change your life for the better.
Lovely description of actual happenings. Thank you, Shirley.
Thanks for the scripture and the post. For me it has been a gradual transformation, where the doctor has been doing surgery a little at a time for 24 years. Either way, it’s a good and blessed thing.
Good evening, everyone, and again thank you for your visits and for your careful comments.
The more I think about it, the more moved I am at the transformation that comes to the person who finds God, who opens the door to his heart and who says, “Change me, Lord, change me Lord. Don’t let me stay the same. For I want to be more like you…..”

"Petty Officer 2nd Class Johnny Oliver’s black guitar still sits on its stand in a corner of Jazmin Oliver’s Jacksonville home.
Pictures of him still hang on the wall and his favorite dog, Ollie the Chihuahua, still scampers around the house and climbs up on visitors’ laps.
Johnny Oliver’s name will be one of four added to the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Wall as part of the city’s Memorial Day ceremonies.
“It’s really hard to accept it,” she said. “I don’t know if I still have. Part of me thinks the military is lying, they needed him for something special and he’ll be back.
“But it’s been a year, and … the day his unit got back I went to the airport and he wasn’t there,” she said.
The couple met when the sailor from Kentucky got back to Kings Bay Submarine Base after a yearlong deployment to Greece.
Oliver sold his car before he deployed, so Jazmin had to pick him up for their first date in the Wal-Mart parking lot just outside the base.
“I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said with a laugh.
But she soon fell for the light-hearted country boy from Kentucky with the infectious smile. “I was the luckiest girl in the world,” she said.
They met in March 2012 and were married by the following March. They rented an apartment near Jacksonville Beach and began to plan their life.
“We wanted to wait a little while to have children and enjoy each other a little first,” she said. “After all, we had the rest of our lives.”
Soon after their marriage, Johnny Oliver’s unit shipped out to Bahrain.
The U.S. Navy maintains a presence on the island nation located between Qatar and Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf.
U.S. personnel off post are told not to wear American flag shirts, American sports teams apparel or anything that make them stand out as an American.
“But Johnny was tall, blond-haired and blue-eyed. All you have to do is look at him and you know he’s American,” she said.
What happened on May 7, 2013, the day her life changed, still hasn’t been resolved.
“Basically what happened was he’d just gotten off work and changed his clothes and was going to dinner with friends,” she said. “He was crossing the street and some lieutenant in the Bahraini police just sped up to 70 and hit him.”
The investigation is continuing.
“They’re [the Navy] trying to make it look like it was just an accident,” she said.
But some sailors with knowledge of the situation told her the driver was trying to hit the young sailor.
“The word is that it was a hate crime, an act of terrorism,” she said. “A lot of the higher-ups in the Navy told me that.”
Ironically, the man who killed her husband was supposed to be put on trial Friday. But the trial again was pushed back.
She said she wants to be there when the trial takes place.
“I want to be there. I want to make a victim’s statement,” she said. “I’m the only person Johnny has left to fight for him.”
Whatever the outcome of the trial, Jazmin Oliver will now have a place to go in Jacksonville to remember her husband — the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Wall.
His body was buried in Kentucky.
“It’s just nice to have somebody remember him,” she said. “Harrison [Conyers of the city’s Military and Veterans Affairs department] has been great making this happen.
“Johnny is in great company.”

"We live in a weird world.
A world where it happens that people get judged a lot by some ignorants who just criticize for the sake of criticizing.
Others just have to get judged because of their race, background, culture, dress code etc.
Well I’m judged everyday. But not me as a person, but as an ethnic group; I am Arab. (well technically, I am Phoenician but this has to do with a little history I don’t want to include right now. Moving on).
I don’t get why a lot of foreigners fear us like we have Ebola or something. I mean, not all of us are terrorists. Not all of us are blood-sucking monsters. Not all of us have a restless desire to kill. There are a lot of wonderful Arabs out there.
Oh, and one more thing: not all of us belong to one religion. We consist of muslims, christians and others as well.
Some foreigners tend to have the idea that because a person is Arab, then that person is muslim. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying being muslim is bad or anything but I am Christian. I’m a 16-year-old Lebanese Christian girl. And I’m proud of it.
Lebanon, like any other country, has it’s bad sides, a lot of them even, but all in all, it is a wonderful country. We are a mixed country. We vary between Christians and Muslims. And we learn to get along. Let me ask you this question: do you fear muslims and Arabs because of a not-gonna-last terrorist group? Trust me, terrorist groups always get weakened and back away and a lot of muslims are actually wonderful human beings.
My point is, do not fear me, or my family, or friends, or my Lebanese people, simply because some utterly inhumane group of people decided to ruin the image of Arabs. A lot of us come in peace, and we mean no harm. So, please, change your perspectives.

"As expected I didn't do well in the main event, busting out after about 5 hours. I played one big pot where I lost 2/3 of my stack with aces against a set. After discussing the hand with several people, I'm quite sure I should of only lost about 30-50% of my stack. No regrets though, aside from that I think I played well and didn't run particularly well. I didn't play any of the other side events or cash games while I was there. I played a decent amount of blackjack though and ran pretty well which helped offset the outrageous costs at Atlantis.
The trip itself has been a lot of fun, I had a few poker playing friends that we spent most of our time with. We ended up renting a cabana one day, jet skied, clubbed, and ate a bunch of restaurants. I didn't do a whole lot of playing online but that's about to change. We left Atlantis today and moved into a condo next to the ocean and will be here for about eight days before moving to another condo. The plan is start playing 8 hours a day, six days a week, for the next three to four weeks. I feel motivated to play right now and am really looking forward to getting back in the swing of things. I'm planning on devoting an hour a day to reviewing sessions and studying hands as well. This is something I was doing in the US and I found it extremely beneficial. Somehow I need to squeeze some exercise into these days and there's no gym here so I'll probably be jogging along the road or beach in our neighborhood. I'm not a big runner, I normally use elliptical machines, so it should be interesting.
I should have another update towards the end of the month. Good luck at the tables.
Good to see you enjoying the fruits of your labor! Keep it up Tony!- JG
Thanks Jeff. Hope you're feeling/doing well. Looking forward to playing some pool when I get back to Cali.
How many hands do you play on average over a year on a day to day basis?
I'm working 4 days a week and was thinking about doing poker aside for 2000 hands a day.
On work days i would like to play 1000-1500 and on free days and make good for what i felt behind.
I have grinded a small the last two months on 0.25/0.5 FR and winning on 0.5/1 SH (only 10k hands) but want to move up as fast as possible to 2/4.....realistic goal in your opinion with a job on the side?
I play an average of about 1500 hands per day but I'm earning a lot more VPPs than you'd be earning at those limits.
I wouldn't want to discourage you but your plan is pretty ambitious. 2,000 hands of fixed limit is a lot, it's not like NL where you can 16 table. At least I can't without sacrificing my win rate. I'd at least give it a try and see what happens but if you see your win rate start dropping off, it may not be worth it.
Good luck.
Oops, made a mess of it. Sorry for the bad language.
I understood it just fine, no worries.
Hi Tony. Best of luck in the next few weeks. As a former runner who recently started up again after a long break, I'd recommend starting with some run / walk combos... Your body will thank you. Running puts a lot of new stresses on your body so it's best to eaze into it.
Start with a brisk walk for 4 minutes / run 1 minute / repeat for 30 minutes or however long you want to work out. Listen to your body and adjust ratios gradually over the course of weeks.
This method is much better than just going out and running 3 miles cold turkey, getting injured or so sore that you never want to run again. :)
madscout
Hey Thanks Ryan and great advice. I didn't end up doing any running mostly due to laziness but I will take your advice if I do start which is quite possible with all this moving around.
What book did you say you had read on running that was really good?
""Born to Run""
That's what I did and it worked very well. I started with the 1:1 walk/run ratio then increased it to 2:2 and 3:3 for the next few weeks before I could finally run for 30 minutes without stopping.
If you're going to read a book about running, I strongly recommend 'Once a Runner'. All of my old college teamates would agree. We passed that around and when it got back to me I read it again.
Thanks Eric, I'll check it out",What is the plan of the person after moving into a condo next to the ocean?,"The plan is to start playing poker 8 hours a day, six days a week, for the next three to four weeks.

"He’s not called Sonic because he has all the speed and grace of somebody trying to reverse park a Volvo station wagon, you know? He’s called Sonic ‘cos he’s FAST, damned fast.
Which raises a teensy-weensy question about the premise of this game, whereby once again Sonic and his mates are plonked onto the kind of hoverboards Marty McFly would drown in drool over, before being sent off to traverse all manner of futuristic racetracks a la Wipeout or F-Zero. Why slow the ‘hog down?! It’s kind of like parking a Ferrari on the back of a truck and sending it out on a track with hopes of breaking speed records. Rather dumb and, frankly, rather pointless.
‘Dumb’ and ‘pointless’; two adjectives which could also be applied to Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity. Another average racing game with Sonic’s head sticky-taped on - why can’t the spiky one get respect nowadays?
After the lukewarm response to the original Sonic Riders – generally agreed to look kind of pretty but handle like a dog in socks on a newly polished roller rink – you’d think the big cheeses at Sonic Team might have had a bit of a powwow as to how to improve things for a sequel. Instead, it appears they just decided to throw in a few kitchen sinks like bullet time, anti-grav, and swapping rings for gear, and hoped for the best.
It hasn’t worked.
Now, for those who just can’t cope with trudging fairly deeply into a review with no real description of what the game is about, we’ll elucidate. Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Dr Identity Crisis and 13 others from both the Sonicverse and SEGAverse are eventually available to take part in a series of races around 16 tracks. It’s all because a ringlike meteorite is gently hurtling (go oxymoron, go!) to ground and sending a bunch of security robots all haywire. Conveniently, Tails has nabbed this ring thing, however a bunch of berserk robots are kind of sweating oil to get it. They chase Sonic; they discover an anti-gravity field; blah blah blah – race time!
While racing games really don’t need back stories, we will give a nod to the lovely animated intro here (even if Sonic does sound like Fry from Futurama); it’s well worth a viewing before subjecting yourself to racing frustration heck.
Why so frustrating? Simple: the controls are crappy. You can hold the Wii-mote sideways or frontwards, using the old school D-pad to control things, or, preferably, jam in a GameCube controller, which at least has a modicum of heft to it. Bought a ‘Classic Controller’? Well, suffer, as it ain’t supported here. Whilst it’s a relief that there’s no insane waggling required, using the D-pad is far from ideal as it tends to leave your thumb with about as much sensation as if it were sculpted from Nerf – and quickly too. Oh, you can do the tilt thing with the Wii-mote to steer, but be prepared to lurch around like a drunken sailor, for it’s about as responsive as one.
Also, in story mode at least, the Wii-controlled players are utter bastards (we refuse to entertain the notion that we’re just shite). It usually just takes one hit on any of all manner of hazards plonked about the courses and you may as well tuck your game into beddybobos and kiss it goodnight, as no amount of speed-ups or generally ace hovering, grinding or otherwise stunting will get you back in the lead. That the bullet time, gravity-bending stuff slows you down, but nobody else, doesn’t exactly help much, either.
“Oh, but online multiplayer would help, surely?” you may inquire. And perhaps it would, however the only sniff of online activity is the ability to share best lap times with the rest of the world, although being able to download the ghosts of racers fast to challenge is reasonably neat-o.
At least some effort has been made to provide some longevity. Between getting through the all-too-brief story mode, cracking the various arcade levels, the requisite training modes and accumulating all the bonus bits and bobs, it will take the average a player a fair bit of Sonic-time to “complete”. As to why anybody would voluntarily do that to themselves, however, is something we can only ponder.
Hurtling around bumping into walls may be fun if you’re all straitjacketed up and safely ensconced in a room with squooshy rubber padding, but when you’re on a hoverboard, facing pointy, hard circuits and it makes you bork races, you could easily end up losing marbles rather than just points. Which, rather neatly, brings us right back to those rubber rooms
… Sunrise, sunset.
Graphics:
Not bad for the waggle box.
Sounds:
Apt FX and music that doesn’t suck.
Control:
Marginally better than Donkey Kong Jet Race…
Gameplay:
Potentially hot, realistically not.
Verdict:
Do what Sonic does best: run!
Rating:
2.5/5",What is the main criticism of the game Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity according to the context?,"The main criticism of the game Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity is its poor controls, which are described as ""crappy"". The game is also criticized for slowing down Sonic, a character known for his speed, and for its lack of support for the 'Classic Controller'. The game's story mode is also criticized for being too brief and the game overall is described as ""dumb"" and ""pointless""."

How does one believe someone with less training and martial arts experience can beat the other?

In a fight where you cant go h2h against the opponent you must fight with energy blasts and such but thing is Roshi has the upper hand there too. In that case you would have to try for you speed as a last bet but as mentioned roshi is capable of catching machine gun fire effortlessly. Based on feats it is an overall stomp for Roshi. But i do believe he would put up a good fight.
Equalize speed and give Roshi prep for a fully charged, fully powered Kamehameha that can pulverize the moon and he takes this with one blast. Remove any one of those advantages and any Yusuke from chapter Black or beyond outright roflstomps him effortlessly.

"Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk predicts his company will sell a ""few million cars"" annually by 2025 — a massive leap over current production — and be profitable by 2020.
The 12-year-old Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker previously said it hoped to sell 500,000 of its stylish vehicles a year by 2020. Musk, who spoke Tuesday at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit, has overshot previous volume estimates. And some models have been delayed, including the Model X SUV, originally planned for 2013 but now on track for this summer, he said.
Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas forecast in December that Tesla will sell 297,000 vehicles in 2020; its 2014 sales are estimated at 33,000.
To meet his big volume targets, Tesla will need to expand beyond its factory in Fremont, California Long-term, Musk said, he'd like another Tesla factory in the U.S., plus plants in Europe and Asia, so it doesn't need to ship cars long distances to meet local demand.
Asked if he would consider building a factory in Detroit, Musk didn't rule it out — but took a shot at the legislature.
""Not out of the question — maybe Michigan shouldn't stop us from selling cars. That would be a nice gesture,"" Musk said.
Last year, Gov. Rick Snyder signed legislation banning automakers from selling vehicles directly to customers in Michigan — a move pushed by local auto dealers to block Tesla from selling cars.
General Motors Co. this week unveiled a concept electric vehicle — the Chevrolet Bolt — that it says can go up to 200 miles on a single charge. It would sell for about $37,500 to compete with a planned lower-cost Tesla car. GM North America President Alan Batey dismissed ideas that the Bolt was aimed at Tesla, which sells the Model S for around $100,000, he said. ""They're for the rich and famous, this is for the people,"" Batey said.
Musk told reporters after the World Congress event that he didn't view the Bolt as a ""competitive threat"" to Tesla because he thinks all cars will eventually be electric. He praised GM for moving ahead, but said there were no features in the Bolt or other new EVs that he wanted to emulate.
Tesla's stock fell $15.24 a share in after-hours trading, or 7.5 percent to $189.38, on Musk's comments that sales in China were ""unexpectedly weak in the fourth quarter.""
Musk said that despite the decline in Chinese sales, a perception of charging problems had been reversed and that the company has recently seen an uptick. He said gains in sales in North America and Europe made up for the decline in fourth quarter-sales in China.
The billionaire founder of PayPal and Space X has become the biggest rock star in the auto industry, making huge bets on batteries and vowing a massive increase in sales. He said he is focused on doubling production capacity and beginning work on the lower-cost Model 3, rather than seeking new deals with other carmakers. But he is open to preliminary talks with automakers about long-range projects.
Musk reiterated he will be CEO until at least 2020 when he expects production to hit 500,000 vehicles. He said he will be at Tesla ""as long as I am alive"" but he may not be CEO forever.
The company is now worth about $25 billion. Musk said by the time the lower cost Model 3 is in full production in 2020 it will be profitable. The Model 3, which will be 20 percent smaller than the $100,000 Model S, will cost $35,000 before the federal tax credit — meaning it would be about $2,500 cheaper than the Bolt.
Musk said he is ""absolutely certain"" that Tesla will cut battery costs by 30 percent by 2020, with further cost cuts to follow. Lower cost may make electric cars more attractive to more buyers. In the meantime, their sales across the automotive industry have remained low and face headwinds with sharply lower oil gas prices.
Tesla has poured the foundation on a new $5 billion battery factory in Nevada to make battery cells beginning in 2016 to reduce battery costs. It is a big bet, Musk said, ""but I don't know any other way to do it."" He said Nevada is ""only providing a few hundred million"" for the factory not the $1.5 billion that some have suggested.

{A Bumbershoot Special Feature}
Yesterday, LicMan19, while our boss was away,
I instant messaged you all afternoon, and you
texted me back from your cubicle, shirking our work.
Verses took shape on our screens, as we each added
lines, taking turns, switching meters and fonts as we typed
lines overlapping, both laughing as if we were
drunk. When our boss saw our sloth and distraction, she roared,
livid, and sent us home. Oh, how I miss you, oh,
LicMan19, and your lively and beautiful words.
Eating my dinner alone left me hungry, and
lying alone left me tired but unable to sleep.
All through the night, in my lust inconsolable,
yearning, half-dreaming, I kept checking e-mail in hopes
you would be there, sharing half-dreams of me, every
time disappointed to find only spam. Now I’m wrecked,
thrashed by fatigue, almost dead in my bed. With this
last ounce of vigor, I write you this poem, to express
all that I feel: new desire, and surprise and, yes,
love. Now you know of my ardor, and you must hit reply.
What if you don’t? Well, let’s see. You remember the
day you skipped work and I covered? I’ll tell the big boss.
You’ll be in trouble, my darling, and lots of it!

Georgia's Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia has signed a hands-free bill into law, rendering the most significant change in the state's driving rules since texting while driving was banned in 2010.
House Bill 673, which prohibits drivers from handling their cell phones and other electronic devices while operating a motor vehicle, goes into effect on July 1, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Deal signed the bill into law on May 2.
Specifically, the new law prohibits drivers from holding or supporting — with any body part — a wireless telecommunications device or independent electronic device such as an iPod. Drivers are also banned from writing, sending or reading any text-based communications while holding a device. Finally, the law prohibits individuals from recording or watching a video while driving, reports the Journal-Constitution.
Drivers are still allowed to talk on their mobile phones or text, but they must use hands-free technology.
The legislation is the result of a marked increase in collision fatalities across the state. More than 1,500 people lost their lives on Georgia roadways in 2017. That tally is approximately one-third more than in 2014.

"Power plant enters planning process
The Four Corners region could be facing a hazy future. A massive, new coal-fired power plant planned for the region is undergoing review, and the public is being asked to comment on the proposal.
The $2 billion plant would be the third coal-burning plant in the San Juan Basin. It would be built on the Navajo Nation roughly 20 miles south of Kirtland and has been tagged the Desert Rock Project. It's estimated that the plant would generate enough energy for 1.5 million homes.
""It's a very large plant at 1,500 megawatts,"" said Dan Randolph of San Juan Citizens' Alliance,
A fourth, smaller plant, named the Mustang Project, is also seeking approval to begin construction between Farmington and Grants, N.M. Originally, the plant was expected to be operational by next year, but there have been delays. Mustang has categorically refused to consider alternative and environmentally friendly technologies, yet recently received a $20 million subsidy under President Bush's so-called Clear Skies Initiative.
While these plants are not within La Plata County's viewshed, they are well within its airshed, according to Randolph. Plus, local air quality is already significantly impacted by the two existing power plants in northern New Mexico.
""A good respiratory health study for the basin has not been done at all,"" Randolph said. ""Before we put more smoke up in the air, we should know what the impacts already are.""
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has invited the public to submit written comments through Dec. 17 on the Desert Rock plant. There is also one public hearing planned in the region and it will take place Tuesday, Dec. 7, at the Farmington Civic Center.
""At this point, there is only one public meeting scheduled locally,"" Randolph said. ""We're pushing for an additional meeting in Shiprock.""
Randolph concluded that this scoping period is an opportunity for locals to raise issues they would like to have addressed during the review process. Written comments can be sent through Dec. 17 to: Eloise Chicharello, director, Navajo Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, P.O. Box 1060, Gallup, N.M., 87305.
Buena Vista voters repeal RGI
One of the poster children for Durango's proposed Responsible Growth Initiative has gone away. On Nov. 2, Buena Vista voters repealed an initiative that required a popular vote for large annexations. It had been in existence for five years and touted as a success story by proponents of Durango's similar measure, which was also rejected by voters Nov. 2.
Buena Vista resident Randy Loback told the Denver Post that easing development restrictions was the only way to keep the town from dying. Loback noted that residents, ""used to be concerned about what's affecting them now. I think a lot of people have turned their thoughts to the long term. What's good for their kids?""
In particular, Buena Vista residents were interested in boosting sales tax revenues by attracting commercial properties. The Post noted that residents have realized that the summer tourism economy is not enough for Buena Vista.
""We have young people graduating who have to move because there's very little here in terms of finding jobs that can pay for you to live,"" said Mayor Sharyle Solis.
Public lands ""passport"" in works
Bikers, hikers and all users of public lands may have to start carrying a ""passport"" when they recreate. An Ohio congressman has successfully pushed a measure through Congress that would require members of the public to purchase an ""America the Beautiful"" pass to recreate on all land managed by the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Reclamation.
Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, succeeded in attaching his bill as a rider to the giant Omnibus Appropriations Bill recently enacted in the lame duck session of Congress. The bill was never passed by the House and was never introduced, given a hearing or voted upon in the Senate. Omnibus bills are considered ""must pass"" legislation because of the potential for a government shutdown.
Regula's bill, HR 3283, allows the federal land management agencies to charge access fees for recreational use of public lands by the general public. The bill has been highly controversial and is opposed by hundreds of organizations, state legislatures, county governments and members of the public.
""This was a victory of pork over principle,"" said Robert Funkhouser, president of the Western Slope No-Fee Coalition. ""Ralph Regula is responsible for the first tax increase of the Bush administration.""
The Regula bill will go into effect when Fee Demo expires at the beginning of fiscal year 2005 unless the new congress acts to derail it. Failure to carry the pass will be a criminal offense punishable by up to $5,000 and/or six months in jail. The America the Beautiful Pass is expected to cost between $85 and $100 annually.
""This is an abuse of position by Congressman Regula"" according to Funkhouser. ""Changing public land policy in the middle of the night via a rider is despicable. Once again the congressman has proven to be hostile to rural and Western values and will stop at nothing to push his agenda.""
Fugitive pot grower nabbed
Members of the Southwest Drug Task Force recently concluded a three-year investigation with the arrest of former La Plata County resident Edward Pole. Pole was arrested on Thursday in Humble, Texas, after evading officers since December 2001. Pole was involved with a ""sophisticated"" marijuana cultivation operation located at the La Plata County home of Lynn Crandall. Crandall and Pole had been charged in U.S. District Court with charges related to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana, conspiracy to distribute marijuana and money laundering.
According to investigators, Pole is believed to have traveled to Canada, Panama and Costa Rica after learning about the December 2001 bust. The task force was able to locate Pole in Texas after he re-entered the United States several months ago.
The Southwest Drug Task Force is a multi-jurisdictional investigative body comprised of the La Plata County Sheriffs Office, Ignacio Police Department and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. The Southwest Drug Task Force routinely files criminal cases in both Colorado State Court and the U.S. Federal Court System.

MANCHESTER - A dump truck plowed into a passenger car on Route 539, dumping the truck's load of stone and trapping the car's driver in place, police said.
Police got word of the crash just seven hours after another dump truck crashed on the same Whiting road, colliding with a box truck that had swerved into the wrong lane, police said.
Officers went to where Route 539 – also called Roosevelt City Road along that stretch – meets Harry Wright Boulevard minutes before 3:30 p.m., according to a prepared statement from police Capt. Todd Malland. They found a 2008 gray Nissan Altima pinned beneath a 2016 Kenworth three-axle dump truck on the northbound shoulder of Roosevelt City Road.

Both cars had been traveling south on Roosevelt City Road, police said. The Nissan was turning left onto Harry Wright Boulevard when the dump truck collided with the sedan's driver side.
""The impact caused both vehicles to leave the roadway and the subsequent collision with multiple signs and trees caused the dump truck to overturn onto the Nissan's roof and spill it's load,"" Malland said.
The cascade of stone and the collapsed roof of the sedan trapped 24-year-old Andrea Penna of Whiting in her driver's seat, Malland said. ""Extensive extrication efforts were conducted and Penna was eventually rescued from her vehicle and transported to Community Medical Center for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.""
MANCHESTER: Whiting man killed in motorcycle crash
Penna's passenger, 22-year-old Kaitlyn McCabe of Lakehurst, and the truck driver, 41-year-old Tayfun Obut of Browns Mills, also went to the same Toms River hospital, also for non-life threatening injuries, police said.
Township police are investigating, Malland said. Investigators, firefighters, medics and workers from the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, Ocean County Sheriff's Office's Crime Scene Investigations Unit, Manchester and Whiting volunteer fire companies, Quality Medical Transport, Monmouth Ocean Hospital Corporation, township Department of Public Works and Ocean County Road Department responded to the crash.

""We would also wish to express our gratitude to the members of the New Jersey State Police, New Jersey Department of Corrections, and other motorists who had stopped to assist with the extrication process,"" Malland said.
The afternoon crash came on the heels of a morning collision that injured 36-year-old Kevin M. Howell of Westville.
Police said 48-year-old Pablo Cespedes of Passaic drove a Freightliner box truck across the center line into Howell's Mack three-axle dump truck.

"Carlos Condit has waited a longtime for his title shot against GSP. The interim welterweight champion talks about wanting to wait for that shot, even if it means he will have a long layoff from the cage.
”
If he does end up waiting, that would defeat the purpose of the interim title and the UFC welterweight division would essentially be at a stand still for what could be 10-11 more months. And with the UFC pumping out shows left and right in this new FOX deal, that would definitely put a strain on headliners.

Hmmmm Seems condit wants to make a big payday by waiting for the paper champion gsp. I guess thats his GAME PLAN. Condit is not hurt but wait he will probably get hurt while sparring maybe his ACL. What a joke the guy ran for 5 rounds now he wants to wait for gsp. Is this the same guy that was willing to step aside and let diaz fight gsp? What a joke this guy is. Me personally i want Diaz/ Condit rematch while the paper champion recoups from his little ouch.

I really dont understand all the Condit bashing?? He is the most exciting fighter in the division who has fought and beaten the best the division has to offer. Which is more than can be said for Diaz. There is a big difference between running and clever footwork. He out struck Diaz and played a smart game. If you want to beat Diaz you have to move, simple. Why should he stand there and let him hit him??? would you??. And as for the big payday, why the fuck shouldnt he wait for it?? look at his record, look how many top notch competitors he has been up against. He deserves the payday, especially over Diaz (who I am a big fan of). To call him a marathon runner is retarded and shows you know nothing of Carlos or the fight game.

He was one of the most exciting fighters in the division. Till his gameplan to run away from Diaz.
The big difference between running and clever footwork? Frankie Edgar has the best footwork in the UFC but I've never seen him turn his back and run away from anyone. I thought Condit was the same type of fighter till that fight. He never ran from anyone before.
It was a good gameplan but a good gameplan would also be to hit a few leg strikes and get a takedown. Who the hell would want to see that.

"Effects of Predator Size and Experience with Predators on Parental Investment in Female Convict Cichlids (Archocenturs nigrofasciatus)Effects of Predator Size and Experience with Predators on Parental Investment in Female Convict Cichlids (Archocenturs nigrofasciatus)
ABSTRACT
Although parental care increases the chances of offspring survival and reproduction, a parent incurs a cost of providing investment because it compromises its own future reproductive success. A parent has to effectively make split-second decisions regarding nest making, foraging, offspring defense, etc. in order to make the most of its time and energy allocations. To maximize the benefits in parental investment trade-offs, a parent makes investment decisions based on brood characteristics such as size, quality, and age as well as its past investment in the current brood. The effects of brood characteristics and past investment in the current brood have been studied extensively. However, there is an absence in the literature regarding the effects predator characteristics have on parental decisions and investment. I studied the parental responses to predator threats on offspring by guarding convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus. To better understand parental decisions in relation to predator characteristics, threats by a heterospecific model predator to offspring were made with variable wait times between attacks and by model predators of various sizes.
A parent may face repeated encounters with the same predator; how should it respond to defending against the same predator again? Because when investing in its offspring a parent incurs costs, the parent should put forth only enough effort and defense to repel the predator. Any extra effort put into the defense could compromise the parent's potential future reproductive success. If a predator does reappear quickly, the parent should increase its investment to ensure the predator is deterred. As the wait time between predator attacks increases, the cost of retaining information about prior encounters increases, while the value of that information decreases. Therefore, I predicted that when times between threats by the same predator are at or less than one minute, a female should increase her parental defense; whereas, if the time between attacks is longer than one minute, a female should not increase her parental defense. To test this, I threatened the offspring of 16 females using the following times between attacks: 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 minutes.
Breeding pairs of convict cichlids were placed in 76 liter fish aquaria (water ranging in temperature from 25-28 degrees Celsius) with six plastic plants and one terracotta flower pot. Within the first day of a pair’s spawning, the male was removed, leaving the female to guard the eggs. Removal of the male allowed for a more precise measurement of parental investment since the investment of only one parent was monitored. On days 4 through 11 of the brood cycle, I threatened the fry with a model predator and recorded the number of times the guarding female bit the model. I then waited the amount of return time specified by the treatment, and then retested the female. Results show that female convict cichlid parents did not significantly modulate their defense efforts in relation to the various wait times between threats toward their offspring.
I also predicted that predator size should influence a parent's investment decisions—the reasoning behind it being a parent would need to expend more effort to deter a larger predator. To test this, I threatened the offspring of 15 females using a large predator model and a small predator model and then recorded the number of times the female bit each model in an experimental setup similar to that of the first experiment. In this experiment, however, the time between predator attacks remained constant (5 minutes), but the size of the predator varied between “large” and “small” (the average adult female standard length is about 50mm; therefore, “large” indicates greater than 50mm and “small” indicates less than 50mm). Each female was subjected to both models, and results show that female convict cichlids defend more aggressively against larger predators.
These experiments provide insight into the effects predator characteristics have on parental investment decisions. Although the wait times used in the first experiment had no significant effect on females’ parental investment, further research could compare wait times with greater differences to find if there exists any consistency or strategy in defending against a returning predator. The second experiment offered insight into a guarding female’s perception of a heterospecific’s predatory ability. From this, further investigations of a parent’s perceived threat to its offspring and a parent’s perceived threat to its own safety could be explored by varying predator size, morphology, marking and coloration, and attack behavior.

"15 Ways to Discover Your Life’s True Purpose
.
Begin by asking yourself this one question: What about you today would disappoint your eight-year-old self? When you are young you have dreams and aspirations along with true passions. Sometimes rediscovering what we liked as children can help guide you toward the path to success and happiness.
Become more active even if it makes you uncomfortable. Start trying new things even if it scares you. Having new experiences and exploring all that the world has to offer can give you some great ideas. Through consistent action, you might just find something you love.
Ask yourself, what do you love? What is it that comes naturally to you? Whatever you enjoy/are good at is surely going to need work. However, this work should not feel like pain. Adapting and improving what comes naturally to you is a wonderful step.
What do you want to contribute to the world? This could be either qualities or services. Defining what you wish to contribute to the world can make all the difference in your search.
Follow your heart. Sometimes listening to your brain alone can get you into trouble. Ok, maybe not trouble, but sometimes you need to listen to your heart to find what you really want.
Try your hand at a passion test, see what it says. This includes at least 15 questions that result in you answering what makes your life ideal. These answers should serve as a reliable guide. You will then go through and 2 x 2 decide which is more important than the other until you reach the bottom.
Take time out for yourself sometimes. When you take time for yourself miraculous things can happen. Too often we are hyper-focused on being with other people. Being alone is not ALWAYS a bad thing. Alone you can find yourself and what truly makes you happy.
Reflect on what has made you the happiest in life. Really think back through your life and the times and/or experiences that made you the happiest. Once you do this, try and translate into a purpose.
Decide about where you want to end up. Clarify your vision and where you physically want to be in life; as in location wise. Begin to act toward achieving these goals.
Come up with a purpose statement. Much like a mission statement at a business, discovering what your perfect world would be like by thinking hard and making a record of it is great initiative. For example: “Creating unique artwork for those who need beauty in their life”.
Craft a sort of vision board. Browse images and utilize them on your board. Find what inspires you or what you desire your life to be like. This should help you figure out more specifically what you really want.
Before you make any long-term decisions, do your homework. If your life’s purpose lies within any type of career, it is important to do the necessary research that will allow you to understand the ins and the outs, the ups and the downs, the good and the bad etc. Only then can you commit.
Live life like the adventure it should be. First, always be positive. Take chances and say yes more often so you can explore and discover what the world has to offer. Find what inspires you and keep reminding yourself. This will give you hope and keep your mind open to new opportunities.
Reflect on what you post most often. It is safe to say that most of spend a decent amount of time on social media. Something you might not realize is the things you post, like, and share say a lot about you. It could also be key to opening the door to your passion.
Follow and put time into your hobbies. While not all hobbies prove lucrative, sometimes it is all you really need to be happy.

AP Auto Racing Writer
CONCORD, N.C. (AP) – The celebration of Chip Ganassi’s success was supposed to be a surprise, an opportunity to gather his great champions and toast their remarkable runs.
He found about it, but the celebration will stay etched in Ganassi’s memory.
“It was one of the more special moments of my racing career,” Ganassi said Tuesday, searching for the words to adequately describe his emotions.
Longtime partner Target last week brought Jimmy V ‘97-98, and Montoya made it four consecutive Ganassi titles in 1999.
Dixon started another four-year run for Ganassi in 2008, and Franchitti added the last three IndyCar championships to the incredible reign.
The core group had an enthusiastic reunion dinner on the first day, and a large luncheon with their Target partners the next. The luncheon included a tribute video to the late Dan Wheldon, who drove three seasons for Ganassi in IndyCar.
“So many years, and so many championships for Chip, and so many friendships,” Montoya said.
It was an emotional two days for almost involved for various reasons. Vasser and Zanardi built an incredibly tight friendship during their time as teammates, and although Zanardi now lives in Italy, the two remain close even though they don’t see each other often.
“Other people could live 1,000 years and not experience the intensity or the emotions of the three years I spent with Jimmy driving for that race team,” Zanardi said. “It is by far the best memories of my racing career.”
For Dixon and Franchitti, it was a chance to sit back and watch the comedy routine of Vasser and Zanardi. While it was a walk down memory lane, it was yet another move toward getting on with business again after Wheldon’s fatal accident in the Oct. 16 season finale. Both were close friends with Wheldon, and his accident lingers over the championship, Franchitti’s third-straight and fourth overall, and the ninth for Ganassi’s open-wheel teams.
“We’ve reflected on the championship, and when I went to the Christmas party with the whole Target team, there was a lot of congratulating each other and all those sort of things,” Franchitti said. “But I don’t think we celebrated it. When we think about it, we are always going to be connected (with Wheldon). That’s just the way it’s going to be.
“So celebrating or not celebrating is not that important. We’re really just motivated to go out and win another.”
Motivation to win races and championships has always been what’s driven Ganassi, and he’s still searching for that formula in NASCAR. It’s the only series he’s yet to find consistent success, and last season was a black-eye for an otherwise banner Ganassi year.
Aside from Franchitti’s title in IndyCar, Scott Pruett and Memo Rojas combined to win their second consecutive Grand-Am title and were the anchors on yet another Ganassi victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Daytona sports car race.
However, Ganassi’s NASCAR teams went winless. Montoya finished 21st in the final Sprint Cup standings, Jamie McMurray was 27th and Ganassi on Tuesday called the overall organization effort “just pathetic for a team with our ability and resources.”
“It certainly wasn’t the first year I’ve had success on one side and not on the other,” said Ganassi, who ordered sweeping organizational changes to his NASCAR operation. He released three top executives, hired industry veteran Max Jones as general manager, chose John Probst as technical director and lured Chris Heroy, a coveted employee at Hendrick Motorsports, to be Montoya’s crew chief.
Ganassi expects early and immediate improvement, and indicated he’s not done shaking things up if the results don’t turn around.
“It was obviously time to make a change and we had to do it, we had to fix it,” Ganassi said. “We took a big swipe at it, and I’m certainly happy with the people that we have now. But if more changes need to be done, we’ll do that as well.”
Nobody doubts he means it.
Franchitti called Ganassi one of the greatest motivators he’s had in his career.
“He’s the driving force. A lot of the success we have comes from Chip’s determination,” Franchitti said. “He hires the right people and then puts them in the right position and then gets on with it. He doesn’t micromanage. If you win and do well, he’s very appreciative. If you don’t win, he’s not shy, he pushes you to get on with it and pick it up.”
And Zanardi, who came to the U.S. with the hardened individualist mentality so prevalent in European racing, credits Ganassi for opening his mind to a team atmosphere.
“When I started to drive for him and win the races, I had picked up a big head, you know, think you are the best,” Zanardi said. “It was always clear he gave me a great opportunity, but I also thought I was helping him. I look at him now and realized he changed my life. Yes, we were winning and having great success, and at the time, I didn’t give much credit to Chip for having created all that.
“But it’s his perseverance, his dedication to what he does, he pours everything into his racing ... he definitely changed my life completely for the better.”
Ganassi deflected all individual credit on Tuesday.
He instead praised his sales team, which on Tuesday announced partnerships with Banana Boat, Belkin products and LiftMaster garage doors and filled all the primary sponsorship for his two NASCAR teams. Everything is sold to the point that across all Ganassi’s organizations, the IndyCar races for Franchitti in Edmonton and China are the only opportunities for a potential new primary sponsor.
Try pinning Ganassi down on what he does to make his organizations successful on the race track and in the business world, and he defers.
“It’s like laying bricks. One brick would be me. Another brick would be Vasser. Another brick would be Zanardi. Another brick was the management team,” he said. “Those are all bricks that you build and one day you look up, you’ve added Montoya, Dixon and Franchitti, suddenly what started out as a brick is now a wall. A strong wall.
“That’s what it’s about. It’s not about me at all. I never drove the cars, I never changed a tire, I never installed the engine or rebuilt anything. I don’t do any of that stuff.”",Who is credited for changing Zanardi's life and how did he do it?,"Zanardi credits Chip Ganassi for changing his life. Ganassi opened Zanardi's mind to a team atmosphere in racing, and his perseverance and dedication to racing had a profound impact on Zanardi's life."

Palembang, SOUTH SUMATERA. Gotong royong is a program promoted by Palembang administration aimed at tackling waste issue and river rehabilitation. The program is held every weekend involving public officials and citizens led by Palembang mayor, Harnojoyo. Palembang has received several awards, including the nationally renowned Adipura award, for its efforts to keep the city clean.
The mutual clean up program has also taken the noble goal of changing the people’s habit of throwing their waste into rivers.
However, three years after the program was first introduced, waste issues in Palembang has yet to be resolved as people are still dumping their waste into nearby rivers and sewers, prompting a huge question mark on the effectiveness of the program.
A study conducted by the South Sumatera chapter of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment shows, residents admit to getting rid of their waste into nearby rivers and channels, putting blame to the absence of a temporary landfill facility. The Palembang administration needs to put the program under review while making sure that the public has access to proper waste disposal facility.

People have left and right been asking to see some updates from me. So, since I've learned to give the public what they want, here's some new renders of some very old sets and props.
First a word on starships...I have to say I am still thoroughly impressed with Sarod's USS Voyager mesh, it's stood the test of time and remains the most accurate mesh out there. I imported it into Bryce and this is more or less his version as presented, the only change I made was to make some of the parts (like the impulse vents and the deflector) light up, and to make the running lights glow. The import caused a few vertex artifacts as you'll see below along the hull, I can't figure out how to eradicate those so if anyone has suggestions I'd love to hear them. Sarod, your starship mesh made a terrific companion to my bridge set! Now if only someone could help me by making me a Voyager captain's chair I'd be set
Also, I've learned how difficult it is to come up with a lighting scheme that will work on a starship from all angles. It finally dawned on me that rarely do you see the sunlight in a shot of the Enterprise-D coming from BEHIND the camera, such that the side you're directly seeing is lit. Usually the sunlight is coming from the opposite side of the ship with fill light coming from the stars, or at the very least the light coming in from a side.
I'm also realizing that, with the TNG shots at least, they were very clever about some of their camera shots, and to duplicate them was more difficult than you might think.
Alright, well without further ado, have a look at some of the newly updated interiors.
Chellik's Office.
This was originally built based on the layout from the Admiral's Quarters on the Battlestar Pegasus, and was meant to be used in concert with the model of the Caretaker's Array that I built some time ago. Simple and elegant, with finish in wood, stone, and glass, this newly refined version bosts an improved lighting scheme and better texturing on the doors.
TNG Observation Lounge (ENT).
As you can see from the credit here, this is how it appeared during the series finale from ""Enterprise,"" titled ""These are the voyages..."", largely similar to the previous appearances in the actual TNG with two major exceptions--the walls here have a much more pink hue to them than they ever did in TNG, and the doors leading into the room were depicted as being orange with red labels, while in the canon TNG they were always seen to be gray. Still, I like the lighting scheme they had in this version, so I decided to do my best to recreate it.
TNG Ready Room.
This is one of my favorites, although it's very difficult to do wide shots in this room because of the odd lines, which look even stranger when you shoot wide with a camera. The very first version of this room was designed to be seen in near-darkness as the scene was more or less a memorial, but I decided that wouldn't cut it so that meant completely redoing the textures and the lighting scheme to match the TV version. Within the context of the story this is to be featured in, this was designed to be on board a ship commanded by an old friend of mine, which is why there's a photo of us on the wall and why my service record is on his desk screen.
VOY Corridor.
The primary change with this version is that the colors are all taken directly off screencaps from the show. It's trickier than you might think, since those gold lights in the top corners affect everything more than it looks like they do. Even so, this set came out really well, and I'm happy with it.
VOY Transporter Room.
Mostly just improvements in texturing with this one, with most of the colors taken from the pilot episode ""Caretaker"" or the first-season episode ""Eye of the Needle."" Between this and the corridor set, I've learned that Voyager had a lot more shades and hues of gray than a casual viewing might make you think. I'm VERY happy with this one though, since it looks a lot more realistic to me than the previous version did.

Taking the Freedom Ride

The Civil Rights Act was signed a half century ago, but it's still a living, breathing law for millions of people. Two American University students have certainly contemplated its legacy. Tatehona Kelly and Daniel Sweig will take part in a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the landmark law on July 2 through the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.
Get on the Bus
As part of this event, Kelly, Sweig, and other college students will ride a bus with some of the original Freedom Riders from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, Va. Along the way, the bus will make brief stops at several sites that symbolize the struggle for racial equality. This will include the U.S. Supreme Court, where the Brown v. Board of Education desegregation case was decided in 1954, and the Lincoln Memorial, scene of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech in 1963.
""I'm excited to be on the bus. I know the first leg of the trip, you sit by someone specific, and then they switch you around so you get to talk to everyone. So I'm excited to see what kind of dialogue occurs,"" says Kelly, a rising senior in the College of Arts and Sciences.
In 1961, the Freedom Riders bravely rode buses in the American South to challenge segregated transportation facilities. One of those activists was Dion Diamond, then a student at Howard University. More recently, he spoke to one of Kelly's AU classes, and now he's scheduled to take part in the upcoming celebration. Other Freedom Riders expected to attend include Rev. Reginald Green and Joan Trumpauer Mulholland.
""As a history major, I just love people's stories. And as a writer, I love people's stories. So I just want to know the Freedom Rider experiences, and learn about things that can be transplanted to today's work,"" says Kelly.
History Lessons, Family Roots
Kelly's family history is emblematic of the African-American experience in the 20th century. ""My great-grandmother was 102 when she passed, and when I was growing up, she used to tell us about working in Mississippi and sharecropping,"" Kelly recalls. Like so many African-American families, they journeyed north during the Great Migration, eventually settling in Ohio. But, as was often the case, discrimination persisted, and both of Kelly's parents dealt with busing and segregation.
Her father's intellect helped shape her consciousness. He is a history buff, and he inspired Tatehona to learn about the nation's tumultuous past. ""'Jeopardy!' was on every night, and we would sit and watch the History channel. And we talked all the time about what he experienced growing up, being born in the 1950s, and seeing all of that transition,"" she says.
The allure of Washington, D.C. brought her to American University. In addition to her coursework in the History Department, she's a minor in public administration and policy in the School of Public Affairs. She's also had valuable internships with the Innocence Project and the Congressional Black Caucus. She's currently writing a grant proposal for the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Kelly is a member of the Black Student Alliance, and she's volunteered for the DC Books to Prisons Project.
Sweig is a nontraditional student, having worked for a number of years before enrolling at Harry S Truman College in Chicago. He transferred to AU in January, and he's currently working with faculty to craft his own interdisciplinary major, ""The politics and economics of criminology.""
Sweig traces his interest in civil rights to his idiosyncratic family background. His father was an American Jew who roped in rodeos, while his mother was a non-Jew born in wartime Germany in 1944. They had him late in life, and Daniel was always grappling with his mixed background.
""I was cognizant of the fact that there was a lot of stress in the family regarding my father's marriage to my mom,"" he says. ""And since I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, naturally I went to a Buddhist preschool. So if I wasn't confused already!"" he jokes. ""Part of my passion for civil rights is my own pursuit of my identity. So I got very interested in history at a very young age, in attempt to figure that out.""
He did a congressional internship with Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., and he's currently working with One by 1 Inc., a nonprofit focused on reducing recidivism and empowering youth.
Bill of the Century
Among other things, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination in hotels, restaurants, and similar public accommodations, and it encouraged the desegregation of public schools. ""No single act of Congress can, by itself, eliminate discrimination and prejudice, hatred and injustice,"" said President Lyndon Johnson, regarding the bill he would sign. ""But this bill goes further to invest the rights of man with the protection of law than any legislation in this century.""
Both Kelly and Sweig applied for and were accepted to be part of this special ceremony. They're not only appreciative of the Civil Rights Act's successes, but they believe it should be enhanced to combat current inequities.
""I think it needs improvement. It's still relevant, and it needs to be fluid for today's growing issues—like the resegregating of schools and districts,"" Kelly opines.
""We still haven't addressed so much, in terms of predatory lending and artificial devaluation of minority communities through predatory foreclosure practices,"" says Sweig.
Social justice advocates believe much work needs to be done. This commemoration should offer a bridge between two generations of civil rights activists. King's impassioned speech in Memphis just before his assassination still rings true, and still offers hope: ""I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.""",Who were the two American University students who contemplated the legacy of the Civil Rights Act and took part in its 50th anniversary celebration?,The two American University students who contemplated the legacy of the Civil Rights Act and took part in its 50th anniversary celebration were Tatehona Kelly and Daniel Sweig.
"Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini once famously said: ""Economics is for donkeys."" Well, looking at the economy of Iran today it is clear that Iran could do with some more donkeys, in the guise of economists. Iran has perhaps the largest combined oil and gas resources in the world. It has about 980 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and about 132 billion barrels of oil. One cannot say that Iran is a resource-poor country, but it is a resource policy-poor country. The increasingly ""conservative"" yet risk-taking leadership is driving Iran's economy into the mud.
A major reason behind this is the huge subsidization for gasoline, diesel fuel, and electricity. Energy subsidies may represent as much as 15-20 percent of GDP, or about $35-40 billion per year. Iran also imports one-third of its gasoline needs to the tune of about $4-5 billion per year. The cost of gasoline in Iran is about 40 cents per gallon. This has prompted a huge and increasing demand for gasoline, well beyond what it would be if the price were in tune with the higher cost Iran pays for its gasoline.
The gasoline subsidy is also an indirect subsidy to Iran's automobile industry, which is pumping out 1 million cars a year into the already clogged streets of Tehran, Isfahan, and other cities. The auto industry employs about 500,000 people. So the argument goes that Iran should keep them employed at huge costs to the country's fragile economy.
Each one of those auto jobs likely costs Iran many times the productivity of each of the workers employed. It would make more sense to move auto workers to more competitive industries. But that's not in the cards.
Subsidizing gasoline and the auto industry has lead to vast increases in air pollution and subsequent health problems, especially in Tehran. So we must also factor in the health effects and costs of such subsidies.
Another cost is the ""opportunity cost"" of the money for subsidizing and importing gasoline and subsidizing the non-competitive auto industry.
Those funds could be going toward developing Iran's severely underinvested oil and gas industries. Maybe the donkeys are right.
Iran has part of the largest natural gas field in the world - what Qatar, which shares the field, calls the North Field, and what the Iranians call South Pars. About half of Iranian natural gas can be found there. Most Iranian oil is located in the southwest of the country, and there are very large new oil fields that have been discovered in the last few years, yet that have not been developed. One of the reasons behind this is the imposition of strict constraints on outside investors: Due to very limiting buyback contracts, investors cannot share in the production and management of the oil fields that they develop.
As an example of the misdirection of resources, take the case of the Oil Stabilization Fund. The fund is designed to stabilize the budget by moving funds from high oil price years to low oil price years. However, it is often ransacked to pay for energy subsidies and gasoline imports. Yet by investing some $75 billion - or just over two years of energy subsidies - Iran could vastly increase its oil production to around 6 million barrels a day from its current 3.9 million barrels a day. For about $85 billion - or two and a half years of energy subsidies - it could bring up to speed its liquefied natural gas trains, pipelines, and production capacities.
Iran also ""flares,"" or burns into the atmosphere, about 7 percent of its natural gas. This is way above the world average, and is a huge waste of resources. Some believe the electricity that could be produced from this flared gas would be equal to about three Bushehr nuclear power plants.
Iran's development of the entire nuclear fuel cycle, not just nuclear power plants, is another misdirection of resources that could bring huge risks to Iran, even destruction. This process will cost tens of billions of scarce revenues. Not even the United States has developed the full fuel cycle.
Arguments that nuclear power is cheap get weaker when we divide the costs of developing the entire nuclear fuel cycle over each bit of electricity produced. Also, Iran has few uranium reserves. Reasonable estimates are that, given a 3,000 to 4,000 megawatt capacity for electricity production, Iran may have five to eight years of uranium in its own reserves. This has to be enriched, built into fuel pellets, put into fuel rods, and so forth.
Iran's argument for nuclear power is that it will have greater energy independence. How does that work when it will need to import uranium for its fuel cycle fairly soon? Another Iranian argument is that if it increasingly produces electricity with nuclear power, it can export more gas and oil. This would be a stronger argument if the Iranians first developed their oil and gas fields. But why set up the entire fuel cycle now, with all the political tensions this has produced and will continue to produce? Why not just develop the nuclear electricity plants, which Iran can do under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? Iran hid some of its nuclear facilities for years, until an opposition group let the cat out of the bag. Why hide those facilities if there was nothing to hide?
Iran is engaged in a terrible misuse of its resources. There seems little sense in subsidizing the nuclear industry, imports of gasoline, the auto industry, overall energy, and more, in a country that must make sound economic decisions on every issue, every day, in order to make its people better off. Economics is not for donkeys. It is for development, prosperity, and peace. It's time for Iran's leadership to smell the coffee and start developing their country, so it gets along better with its neighbors and the world. The leaders claim to exist for their people. I wonder.
Paul Sullivan is a professor of economics at the National Defense University and Georgetown University, both in Washington DC.",What are some of the economic issues facing Iran according to the context?,"Iran is facing several economic issues including a huge subsidization for gasoline, diesel fuel, and electricity which may represent as much as 15-20 percent of GDP.

"A beautiful big pile of plastic bottles, plus a plastic chair on the Canterbury side of the Cooks River next to the Illawarra Road Bridge. All these were collected from the muddy bank just below.
About 5-metres to the left of the pile of plastic bottles shown in the photo above a White-Faced Heron was foraging for food under the Illawarra Road Bridge. There are more bottles & tins around him. Seeing wildlife like this reinforces the need to clean up their home.
For a few months now I have been noticing piles of dirty plastic bottles on both banks of the Cooks River. It seems that some local hero is spending quite a bit of time collecting the bottles & other pieces of plastic litter & putting them in a pile ready for either Marrickville or Canterbury Council to remove them.
To whoever is doing this, I thank you. You are one of those quiet achievers in the community whose work is largely unrecognized. It’s hard & dirty work.
It is not uncommon to see both adults & children fling their plastic bottle away once they have emptied it. Seeing the piles of bottles is a strong message to stop littering. One bottle doesn’t look like much, but a pile does.

"An awful lot of PC gamers buy an awful lot of PC hardware through Amazon. The prices are good, the selection is great, you can go shopping to your heart's content literally without budging from where you're parked right now, and deliveries, while ethically dubious, are fast and reliable.
One part of the experience that isn't always quite so reliable, though, is user reviews. In an update posted today, Amazon said that while it strives to ensure that customer reviews ""accurately reflect the experience that customers have had with a product,"" it warned that fake reviews are becoming increasingly difficult to deal with.
""In 2020, we stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer, and more than 99% of reviews enforcement was driven by our proactive detection,"" Amazon wrote. ""In addition to stopping these reviews, we take action to shut down and stop review submissions from the accounts contributing the fake reviews and to enforce the bad actors' selling accounts trying to artificially benefit from this abuse.""
That sounds like a pretty successful campaign against abuse, but because of those efforts, perpetrators have begun taking fake reviews off-site, particularly through social media, either directly or through a third-party service. This is where the situation grows more complicated: Amazon said it uses ""a number of techniques, including advanced machine learning,"" to combat off-platform abuse, but it's much more challenging to deal with it effectively when it's happening elsewhere, and the numbers are going up.
""In the first three months of 2020, we reported more than 300 groups to social media companies, who then took a median time of 45 days to shut down those groups from using their service to perpetrate abuse,"" it wrote. ""In the first three months of 2021, we reported more than 1,000 such groups, with social media services taking a median time of five days to take them down.""
Social media platforms are obviously much faster in responding to complaints these days, but in order to address the problem ""at scale,"" Amazon said they need to invest more in ""proactive controls to detect and enforce fake reviews ahead of our reporting the issue to them."" It also called on consumer regulation agencies for ""coordinated assistance"" in bringing legal action against fake review service providers and those who use them.
""We need social media companies whose services are being used to facilitate fake reviews to proactively invest in fraud and fake review controls, partner with us to stop these bad actors, and help consumers shop with confidence,"" Amazon wrote. ""It will take constant innovation and partnership across industries and law enforcement to fully protect consumers and our honest selling partners.""
It might be difficult to work up much sympathy for the travails of the multi-billion-dollar behemoth Amazon, but user review abuse is a long-standing and widespread problem. Probably the best-known example among PC gamers is that of Valve, which has struggled with the problem for years. Despite measures including ""histogram"" charts, the exclusion of ""off-topic"" reviews, and automated prompts to update old reviews, it's still a problem: Nier: Automata suffered a significant review-bombing in March at the hands of users who wanted it updated to match the version available on the Windows Store. If Amazon is able to come up with an effective strategy to meaningfully reduce user review abuse, it could prove beneficial for other platforms and storefronts (and everyone who uses them) in the long run too.",What measures has Amazon taken to combat fake reviews and what challenges does it face?,"Amazon has taken measures to combat fake reviews by stopping more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were seen by customers in 2020, with more than 99% of reviews enforcement driven by proactive detection.

""I’m looking forward to serving in this capacity to help ensure the safety and security of individuals and intellectual property for Americans, as well as for citizens of other nations,” Harker said.
Delaware’s Congressional delegation – U.S. Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons and U.S. Rep. John Carney – congratulated Harker on his appointment.
“I commend Secretary Johnson for appointing Dr. Harker to this important body,” said Carper, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. “Under Dr. Harker’s direction, UD has become a recognized leader in areas like cybersecurity, disaster response and biosecurity. For years, those of us in Delaware and the academic community have witnessed his leadership and knowledge first-hand, and now he will be able to lend his expertise in support of the Department of Homeland Security’s mission. I know Dr. Harker’s counsel and the work performed every day at the University of Delaware will be especially valuable to Secretary Johnson and his team at the Department.”
Coons added, “More than ever before, our economy and security depend on the skills of a highly trained cyber workforce. Expanding that workforce to meet our growing needs is a national security imperative, and thanks to the leadership of President Harker, that work is happening in earnest at the University of Delaware. President Harker’s vision and dedication have helped make UD a national leader in defense research and education, and I know he will bring the same vigor to his role on the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council. I look forward to following his work and congratulate him on this well-deserved honor.”
And Carney said, “The University of Delaware, under the leadership of President Harker, has become a center of excellence conducting critical research on cybersecurity, protecting the country’s food supply, and defending the nation from other threats both inside and outside the country. President Harker’s appointment to the Department of Homeland Security’s Academic Advisory Council will help keep UD on the cutting edge of the nation’s research needs, and better utilize the tremendous work being done by its faculty and students.”
The University is performing cutting-edge research on many homeland security issues. UD’s new cybersecurity initiative headed by national defense expert Starnes Walker will establish a pipeline of graduates with the skills required to address the evolving threats in cyberspace. UD is also home to world-class avian influenza research, as well as the Disaster Research Center and its specialized library containing the world’s most complete collection on the social and behavioral aspects of disasters.
Harker has been president of the University of Delaware since 2007, and came to UD after serving as dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He has previous experience with the federal government, having been named a White House Fellow in 1991 by President George H.W.

"Tiger wrestlers enjoy team, individual success in ‘12-’13.
“We had a great season,” said coach Troy Ostby. “We ended the season right where we should have been.”
The Tigers reached all but one of their goals this season, and that was making it to the final four in the Section 3AA team tournament. The Tigers won their first match to advance to the quarterfinals, but Lac qui Parle Valley/Dawson-Boyd ended the Tigers’ team season.
The Tigers lose four wrestlers to graduation. They are seniors Connor Metzger, Joel Harrison, Evan Nelson, and Seth Nelson.
“These are four kids that have come up through our program,” said Ostby. “They have shown leadership and won big matches for us.”
Evan Nelson finished the season 29-15, taking fourth at the section tourney. Nelson wrapped up his career 79-60 overall.
“You could always count on him down low to keep us in the dual,” said Ostby. “I expected him to win.”
Seth Nelson finished 8-19, taking fifth at sections. He had a career record of 41-71.
“Seth came on in the end of the season. He won a couple of matches that helped us win duals,” said Ostby. “Because of his win, we won a couple duals.”
Metzger was a state entrant, taking second in sections, and finished the season 34-8. Metzger placed fifth at the state tournament. Metzger finished his career 85-51.
“Connor’s hard work and dedication made him a good leader,” said Ostby. “He was expected to win. No matter if he was wrestling a No. 1 ranked wrestler or not.”
Harrison wrapped up his senior season 28-7, just missing a state trip by dropping a true-second match to take third in the section. He wrapped up his career in orange and black with a 70-53 record.
“He was the hardest worker on the team by far,” said Ostby. “Connor will admit that because of Joel, he went to state.
“We’re going to miss these boys,” added Ostby. “They were like big brothers to the young kids.”
Several young kids are coming up to help fill the spots left open by the seniors, including 17 wrestlers with at least some varsity experience.
Junior Dillan Johnson, the other Tiger state entrant, took first place in Section 3AA and finished the season 29-13.
“Dillan had his best wrestling at the end of the year,” said Ostby. “His technique improved and he was finding ways to win the close matches.”
Myles Smith finished the season 17-15 and took fourth at sections.
“If he stays healthy, Myles will be in contention to go to state,” said Ostby. “He’s got all the tools.”
Travis Ostby finished his freshman year 25-18, placing third at sections after losing a true-second match.
“He’ll be a key in our middle weights,” said Ostby. “He can wrestle up a weight or two to help us match up well in duals.”
Alec Gausman finished his sophomore year 9-24.
“He’s going to be our big guy next year,” explained Ostby. “He’ll need to step up and be the anchor for us.”
The highlight of the season for coach Ostby was finishing 12th of 35 teams at the Big Bear Tournament in December. The Tigers had five place winners at the invite. Ostby describes the invite as a “mini state tournament.”
At the Belgrade-Brooten-Elrosa tournament, the Tigers placed fifth and had another five place winners. The Tigers took fourth at the Grant County Tournament, earning 10 individual place winners. At the Big Ole Tournament in Alexandria, the Tigers finished sixth and had seven wrestlers place. The Tigers were fourth at the West Central Conference Tournament, where eight Tigers placed. Travis Ostby, Evan Nelson, Connor Metzger, and Joel Harrison earned all-conference status at the meet. Dillan Johnson received an honorable mention.
The regular season wrapped up with the Tigers’ home invite at which 11 wrestlers from the home team placed.
“That was pretty impressive,” said Ostby. “It was awesome. With the talent we have we were right where we should have been. We peaked at the right time.”
Ostby is looking forward to next season and is excited about the Tigers’ opportunities. Two teams, Adrian and Montevideo, will no longer be part of Section 3AA. Joining the Tigers’ section will be New Ulm. Adrian was the section champion this season and also took seven individuals to the state tournament.
“That makes our chances even better in 2014,” explained Ostby. “That’s seven more spots for our kids to get to state.”
Making it to the state tournament will require wrestlers to get in a lot of wrestling in the off-season and attend a couple of camps. Mick Rose is running a freestyle Greco league for K-12 wrestlers this summer.
The Tigers experienced success in the classroom, as well as on the mat, earning the Silver Award for Academics with a GPA of 3.43.
“The kids understand what it takes,” added Ostby. “Our goal is to win championships. We won’t be satisfied until we do.”",Who were the four senior wrestlers that graduated from the Tiger team in the 2012-2013 season?,"The four senior wrestlers that graduated from the Tiger team in the 2012-2013 season were Connor Metzger, Joel Harrison, Evan Nelson, and Seth Nelson."

so it's alain not aran?
I want to watch this now!
Also will this be cannon or is it like a hyper battle dvd or something?
Hmm that actually looks more interesting then the series itself ( i hope it gets better now that necrom made a strong first appearence)
Well, from what I can see, this shows Alan in a whole new light. Would this be canon and show him as a redeeming character, or simply affirm his role as a villain when it ends. I mean, wow, he hangs out with the Ghost gang. Seriously, they didn't even recognize him?
We'll see what happens when it comes out and gets subbed.
the katakana written a-ra-n, so its should be aran/alan not alain
But he's not a hero, he's a villian
Since people are being stupid already, I believe the point of Alain as we're now calling him is that he's a hero in his own mind and from our perspective as humans following the hero of Ghost he would be a villain but what he's doing isn't wrong for his people. Did any of you even pay attention when Robin Hood was dropping knowledge? He's probably gonna be an aloof ally who struggles with betraying his kind or his own friendships and relationships he develops with humans.
i hope he stays a hero because if he does maybe he won't die or it could be chase again?
This seems like something sad in the end is going to happen, I'm looking forward to this
Let's just say he's an anti-hero for now. I wouldn't surprise if Alan (or Alain, or whatever you like to call him) is going to change sides, like how Chase did.
""the katakana written a-ra-n, so its should be aran/alan not alain ""
But it clearly has ""Alain"" in the title card when it pops up. If that's what's Toei says, who are we to argue?
But Kamen rider likes to give its villains redeeming qualities. Plus if you think about it, in a battle of people from opposing worlds, there are no heroes or villains, it is merely a battle of ideals. Aran's ideals are that individual life and physical bodies mean nothing, mostly because as a ganma he never had a need for such things. Takeru and by extension the human race find this to be evil because that is how our world is. Villains and heroes don't exist. As said by Kamen rider sangou, "" If you you lose you are labeled by history as evil.""

Hedge funds have long been the envy of the investment industry, with complex and precisely executed trading strategies. While access to this group of funds remains with a select few, often institutional mandates or high net worth individuals, their presence is always felt and known by the average investor. But how have hedge funds been performing? The average investor often hears about the success of these rarefied funds, in the hope of being able to achieve similar returns. This year’s Canadian Hedge Funds Awards night, produced by Alternative IQ and sponsored in part by Fundata, is coming up on Oct. 16. So in this article I’ll lift the veil of mystery just a bit, and take a look at what made some of last year’s award-winners tick.
Hedge funds are an essential tool for diversification of an investment portfolio, especially when markets are volatile and move in zig-zag patterns. You might have noticed a recent spate of articles with the general theme of “the return of volatility.” While this is one signal of market behavior, it can also be a call for investors to consider hedge funds and alternative strategies.
The ratio of advancers-to-decliners in the past few years has been high, in essence testing the competence of hedge fund managers who consistently pursue long-short strategies. When the market is continually moving up, long-short strategies can be challenging. A fund might post high returns on its long positions, but these returns are cannibalized by the relatively low or even negative returns from short positions. This is possible in the market we have grown used to, where there is no volatility and markets continued to move in only one direction, up.
As we look forward to this year’s CHFA Awards, it might be useful to look back at the past performance of some of Canada’s premier hedge funds in 2017. Listed in the table and graph below are selected hedge funds that were showcased for their 1-year return track record in their respective categories.
The slope of return over risk is analyzed to categorize performance to yield one unit return for every unit of risk an investor accepts. Picton Mahoney manager Philip Mesman has been able to use his investment mandate to achieve alpha leading to a slope greater than 1 for its investors, being the top-performing fund amongst its peers.
Shown in the table and graph below are a select few hedge funds that were showcased for the 5-year return track record in their respective categories.
Note the Barometer Global Macro Pool is included for its exceptional performance in both 1-year and 5-year categories.
Notable here is that the CC&L mandate uses an internal team dedicated to analyzing 12,000 stocks across developed and emerging equity markets daily on various quantitative factors.
Donville Kent Capital Ideas Fund posted an impressive 12.79% return with an annualized standard deviation of 7.63%. The fund equates to a slope of 1.68, being the top-performing fund among its peers in the 5-year category.
I spoke recently with Jesse Gamble, a portfolio manager at a Toronto-based hedge fund Donville Kent Asset Management, to find out what factors enabled the Donville Kent Capital Ideas Fund to rank among the best hedge funds in Canada:
“What makes a good company is return on equity. We believe in the theory of reinvestment and compound returns,” said Gamble. “What creates a high ROE business is stable and improving margins at the company level. These companies offer an attractive risk-to-reward ratio as a byproduct of selecting excellent companies, hence effectively managing risk,” he added.
According to Gamble, “While ROE is such a key metric, most managers simply look at profit and not ROE. Gauging the stability of ROE is incredibly important here at DKAM where we boil down the components and perform a DuPont analysis to see where the accretion and dilution in growth is coming from. We also take it one step further by looking at long-term contracts, margins, if the company has high barriers to entry, and what type of market in which it operates.
In addition to crunching the numbers, DKAM also focuses on corporate management. “We like to know that the management of these superstar companies speak our language,” says Gamble. “We need to know that management knows and understands the company and industry,” he added.
Gamble concludes that this type of in-depth research “will help facilitate management to effectively deploy capital to offer high returns for shareholders. This is how we continue to excel in the hedge fund space and offer great returns to our investors.”
Achieving high risk-adjusted returns is challenging in an extremely competitive hedge fund universe. But with strong quantitative and qualitative analysis, as well as looking beyond profitability and attractive top and bottom numbers, you may be able to invest in something worth multiple times what the market has priced for such companies.",What is the key factor that enables the Donville Kent Capital Ideas Fund to rank among the best hedge funds in Canada according to Jesse Gamble?,"The key factor that enables the Donville Kent Capital Ideas Fund to rank among the best hedge funds in Canada is focusing on return on equity (ROE).

Gisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths by Denise Markonish, Eve-Lyne Beaudry, Rebecca Duclos (Hard book explores twenty-five years of work from contemporary artist Gisele Amantea. Gisele Amantea's twenty-five year career features in a stunning new hardcover volume. Materially rich and with great attention to design and ornamentation, Amantea's installations delve into questions of history and memory, particularly as related to women. This mograph follows the evolution of Amantea's career starting with her early works that are exuberant examples of the rococokitsch style typical of her practice. These pieces demonstrate her interest at that time in the symbols of folk culture and the stereotypes usually associated with them. The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent. The last section is devoted to the artist's current practice and features hitherto unseen pieces deting her preoccupation with the concept of barriers and the use that has been made of them by various cultures w and in the past.

"I’ve been working on a project recently looking at lack of awareness of the Internet. In the U.S. we take for granted that most people know what the Internet is and have a general sense of what it can do, even if they don’t use it themselves. However, even in the U.S., there were (and still are) people that don’t know what the Internet is.
In the Caucasus, not knowing what “the Internet” implies is not uncommon in some places – 1% of Armenians, 22% of Azerbaijanis, and 7% of Georgians report that they don’t know what “the Internet” is (in 2010).
Who are these people? They’re older, they’re rural, they have less education, and they’re poorer.
And, generally, people that are not aware of what “the Internet” is are highly unlikely to ever use the Internet.
The next step is ever using the Internet. In Armenia, two-thirds of citizens have never used the Internet, a little over half (55%) of Azerbaijanis have never used it, and 61% of Georgians have never used it (in 2010).
Again, the people that are not using tend to be older, more rural, less educated, and poorer.
Finally, the last Internet hurdle is frequent use. Many Caucasus “Internet users” are getting online less than once a month. Certainly these infrequent users are not fully benefiting from Internet use. 10% of Armenians, 11% of Azerbaijanis, and 11% of Georgians are online quite infrequently.
So while official statistics from the ITU say that 37% of Armenians, 36% of Azerbaijanis, and 27% of Georgians are online because they define “Internet user” as going online once or more ever, I’d argue that this is adoption, and we should really be discussing frequent users (at least weekly). In that case, 21% of Armenians, 9% of Azerbaijanis, and 18% of Georgians are fully benefiting from Internet use.
Who are those frequent users? They’re generally urban (although in Armenia and to some degree Georgia, there are some rural frequent users, mostly via mobile Internet), better educated, younger, and wealthier.
At least we can see that there has been an increase in awareness, use, and frequent use since 2009. In 2009 71% of Armenians, 62% of Azerbaijanis, and 65% of Georgians knew what the Internet was, and 15% of Armenians, 14% of Azerbaijanis, and 17% of Georgians had ever used it. Frequent users in 2009 were 8% of Armenians, 6% of Azerbaijanis, and 10% of Georgians.",What are the common characteristics of people in the Caucasus who are not aware of the Internet or do not use it frequently?,"The common characteristics of people in the Caucasus who are not aware of the Internet or do not use it frequently are that they are older, more rural, less educated, and poorer."
"When he was a young adult Peter Kitundu met the missionary doctor in Kiomboi, TZ. With the help of that doctor. Life expectancy in TZ was 46 years when Peter met the medical missionary. Now it is 67.
Today Paul reminds us that in Jesus’ resurrection God makes obvious that God loves us enough to give his only son, and that death does not have the last word. God’s Word is first and last.
With the first Word God created the world. God provided the necessities of life for all: clean air, clean fresh water, plenty of food, clothing as needed, shelter sufficient … and God said it all is good.
For generations we have perverted our unequal gifts from God into a measure of God’s blessing. We turned our having more than enough into an entitlement and a proof that God favours us and does not favour other people who do not have enough in order to survive.
While we can be that evil, God also provides for us the great wisdom that Jeremiah points us to. Like trees planted next to streams of flowing water God’s wisdom gives us endurance even through times of drought, times when around us all wisdom and truth evaporate.
In today’s Gospel Jesus provides some of this wisdom for us, a corrective to our perversion that our abundance is proof that we are blessed and the poor are not. Jesus proclaims that the poor are the ones who are blessed, that those who hunger are blessed, that those who mourn are blessed, that those who others revile are blessed.
Brian Rude receives guests in Central America, introducing them to Christians caught in desperate poverty. Even as the people who live there fear that they or their family members or their friends will be ‘disappeared’, these poor people worship with gratitude, these people celebrate exuberantly. Like the people in TZ, these Christians know how to love: more proof that God indeed blesses people who are poor, who are hungry, who mourn, who are reviled.
Still there are many times in history when we stubbornly refuse to accept what the Gospel teaches and Liberation Theology reminds us of: that God has a preferential option for the poor, that God blesses the poor more than the wealthy, who today are among the richest people ever to walk the face of the earth.
Instead we have turned Jesus’ blessing of the poor mistakenly said it in many and various ways: The poor will always be with us. Poverty and homelessness cannot be ended. There is not enough for everyone so some people will always go without. Life is a zero sum game.
We end it all by saying: we do not need to change how it is for them because God blesses them in their poverty, hunger, grief, and ruin.
As if knowing we would turn their blessings into our excuses not to love them Jesus adds a series of warnings for the remind us that our blessings are not ours to keep. They are meant to be shared with those who do not have enough.
Last week an amber alert garnered over 300 responses as they looked for a missing 11 year old girl. The calls were not about the girl. They were from people who felt entitled to use 911 to complain that the amber alert had been sent out after 11 pm and disturbed their sleep. These complaints almost kept the lines too busy for the helpful responses to get through; still the help was too late.
Dorothy Soelle, theologian d.2003 added 2 items to the list of the necessities of life. She added: meaningful labour, and love (both to be loved and the opportunity to love others.) We know that the poor, the hungry, those who mourn, and those reviled often have great capacity to love; to love their neighbours as themselves, and to love even their enemies; and to love God with all their hearts, minds and strength. Jesus pronounced this blessing for the common people on the plain.
By comparison this is what most rich, well fed, joyful, those spoken well of are missing. They seem too often incapable of accepting God’s gift’s as blessings to share. Something obstructs their knowing how to love their neighbours or themselves, and especially how to love their enemies. They love the security their abundance provides so much that they have no room left to love God with all their hearts, minds, and strength … and that is the greatest curse of all. Without love, we are nothing.
Love, so profound that one loves one’s enemies, is only possible when we recognize that God first loves us, though we do not deserve in 2011. His widow, Mary, and that medical missionary and numerous other people joined together to rebuild some of the basics of health care in TZ. Peter’s brother eventually convinced this group, who call themselves IHP-TZ (ihptz.org), to take 30 acres he had north of Dar es Salaam and build the first hospital for children in TZ. With funds raised by that medical missionary now in his 90’s, the local crew and visiting medical, construction, and all kinds of volunteers from around the world make the next part of the hospital a reality.
There is another true story, originally about an Appalachian family in the US. It is perhaps truer for us if told set in the north of AB.
A social worker is assigned. Satisfied that these people are providing a good education for their children she prepares to leave. The father wraps up a piece of moose meat as a gift for her. She starts to refuse it, appalled that she would take anything away from the little they have. Seeing her resistance the father with wisdom, welling up from ancient streams of truth, insists she accept their gift saying, “I know it looks like we are poor, but we are not poor. You are only poor if you cannot give something to others.”
Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.
Having received so much, we each have so much to give, or not! Amen",What is the message conveyed by Jesus in the Gospel according to the context?,"Jesus proclaims that the poor are the ones who are blessed, that those who hunger are blessed, that those who mourn are blessed, that those who others revile are blessed."
"Sensors and actuators are taking the next evolutionary step and forming integrated systems
Smaller, cheaper, faster, cleaner, smarter. The demands in industry today are many. And only a combination of mechanics and electronics can deliver them. On a miniature scale, this combination is known as microelectromechanical systems or MEMS.
When MEMS technology first surfaced, it quickly grabbed the attention of the engineering community. Many thought it would be a short time before this technology affected almost everything. But it hasn't quite worked out that way.
MEMS-based sensors are progressing well from research and development to commercialization. They are often found in office products such as ink-jet printers and hard disk readwrite heads. In automotive applications, they're combined into systems containing micro-actuators and circuits to control the activation and deployment of almost all air bags. And in medical applications, they can be found in a host of devices from pacemakers to hearing aids.
MEMS-based actuators, however, have not made the transition from research to commercialization as quickly. Part of the reason lies with the difficulty in building MEMS engines with sufficient torque, and in joining tools to them. Another reason is the need for new fabrication techniques that permit batch production.
As researchers overcome these hurdles, actuators grow more commercially viable. In fact, new applications are beginning to appear, from microrobotics and noncontacting wafer transport systems to ultraprecise positioning.
The single state
Government research labs and facilities, such as the Microelectronics Development Laboratory at Sandia and Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC), have been instrumental in developing new fabrication approaches that boost torque and lessen the difficulty of connecting tools to MEMS devices. Some of the promising techniques include multilevel polysilicon micromachining and single-level polysilicon structures machined on CMOS substrates.
Polysilicon micromachining is a thin film process. Each material layer is four microns or less in thickness. Typically, layers of material are added to a substrate structure one at a time. Before the next layer is built, though, the previous layer undergoes any photoresist, exposure, and etching steps.
Until recently, microstructures usually used one layer of polysilicon. The latest sensors and actuators are built with four layers of this material and undergo eight or more masking steps in a process known as multi-level polysilicon micromachining. Three of the layers are movable polysilicon separated by layers of oxide.
For example, researches at Sandia Labs can make an electrostatic comb drive from one layer of mechanical polysilicon and a ground plane. With another layer of polysilicon, they can create a gear mechanism that rotates about a hub, as well as out-of-plane mirrors with hinges. By adding a third layer and ""planing"" away a sacrificial oxide layer, they were able to form linkages between actuators and output gears. These gears can rotate at speeds over 300,000 revolutions per minute.
The planing process, known as chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), is a type of annealing that is usually used on the upper layer of polysilicon on a structure. An abrasive slurry smoothes the polysilicon surfaces, both top and underside, removing excess features that would interfere with the movement of bearings and gears formed in other layers.
This process lets researchers create complex monolithic structures, such as interlocking gear trains and adaptive optical systems, that combine logic, drive, and signal processing electronics with micro-mechanical devices. Such devices are expected to replace the multi-chip format of past MEMS devices.
By combining these functions, today's MEMS devices possess intelligence and the capability to handle multiple tasks. An intelligent micromachine, for example, can signal for more power, indicate whether it's operating too fast or too slow, and automatically execute software routines. Such systems-on-chips include combination locks used to protect networking equipment, pop-up mirrors recently introduced for fiber-optic communication, and multi-axis accelerometers.
Researchers continue to experiment with additional layers of polysilicon, sacrificial oxide, and CMP steps. For example, with a fifth layer of polysilicon and a second CMP process, researchers created a gear train with moveable platforms.
A new union
The other MEMS processing technique, which combines polysilicon surface micromachining with CMOS, is being used to produce sensors and microelectronic control circuits on single-layer chips. By integrating control circuitry on a MEMS device, researchers can reduce parasitic noise associated with low-level stimuli at the interconnections.
Sandia's technique for combining CMOS and surface micromachining is to first make the MEMS components, then continue with conventional CMOS processing on the same wafer. The micro components are made in a trench etched into the wafer surface. Once done, the trench is backfilled with oxide as needed. The oxide bridge helps metal layers across the uneven surfaces of the two parts of the device.

Using this method, BSAC developed an inertial measuring sensor that measures six degrees of freedom. It has a three-axis accelerometer and an XYZ gyroscope for navigation. The sensor measures less than 1 cm2. Other devices that use IC-based packaging include Hall and magnetoresistive sensors, and silicon accelerometers.
And many MEMS devices are still fabricated using more traditional techniques, such as LIGA. This German acronym roughly translates as lithography, electroplating, and molding. The fabrication steps include X-ray exposure of a resist material, plating, and then the removal of more resist until developers reach the desired microstructure.
Still to come
The remaining barriers to the expansion of MEMS include a lack of standard testing methods, a definition for acceptable reliability, standard packaging formats, and competition with existing technologies.
So far, testing equipment and methodologies have been specific to the developer of the micro device. Because each manufacturer tests for different attributes, it's often difficult to evaluate differences among various devices.
The same is true of performance measurements. There are no definitions that spell out minimum acceptable performance or reliability levels.
Most approaches to packaging are also company specific because they are seen as competitive advantages. This situation is especially prevalent with European developers. Apparently, the development community is waiting for users to set the standards.
Many interested parties, though, fear that the lack of agreement on size, height, and other form factors will retard industrial and commercial growth.
And lastly, work must still be done on linking micro devices to the macro ones we're all familiar with. So, although there's been progress, it may be a few more years before MEMS technology fulfills its initial promise.",What are some of the challenges in transitioning MEMS-based actuators from research to commercialization?,"Some of the challenges in transitioning MEMS-based actuators from research to commercialization include the difficulty in building MEMS engines with sufficient torque, and in joining tools to them.

He is extremely giving and I know that he was a great father and coach. BUT, if you were on his bad side, watch out.
Mike *ALWAYS* played hard. He was an incredible athlete and a champion wrestler. Obviously he had a lot of aggression and he was fearless. I wasn’t too surprised to hear how well he handled it when an M80 went off in his hand and he lost half his thumb. I also wasn’t at all surprised when I heard he enlisted in the Army. Likewise, I wasn’t too surprised when I heard that he was discharged after serving time in the brig for burning down his CO’s barracks after a disagreement. While that was heresay, I believed it; due to Mike’s aggressiveness, fearlessness, and take-no-sh!t attitude. I have no doubt that Mike would have been an incredible soldier in the field; always there for his brothers and sisters and committed to fight to the end.
Bottom line…. Great guy most of the time. But I wouldn’t want to be anywhere near him when he was mad. I know he loved his girlfriend with all of his heart, yet he was arrested for punching her in the face. I honestly wonder if he was bi-polar.
It’s a shame that he never received the help he needed. It’s very unfortunate that the Army wasn’t able to help him.
My sympathy goes out to his girlfriend, kids and family.
Yes Really will respond
you self rigthous LIERS… it must be so wonderful to be NOT PERFECT…
every one of you have and an inncident whether you want to admit it or not.. you are no different and have no right to Crusify this man just because of some accusations… Maybe he did Maybe he didn’t but either way he has touched many in his time with us for the good so shut your mouth and go find something to do w all your time.
Mike and his family will continue to be welcome. why because he has never done anyhting to disrepect me or my family and he has brought joy to those he has touched…. how bout that..
you are entitled to your opinion however don’t play like you are perfect cause we know your not..
I wish the family well and hold on it will be a long bumpy road just know you have support..
REALLY!!!
Really, no one is claiming to be perfect, which by the way is not the argument here. Your friend may be nice to you but he’s a thug to others. If you can’t understand that, well that make yous either a thug or a moron. Either character is rather unsavory.
Really………….you need to open your eyes
How awesome is that DNA database for catching criminals? A murder about 8 years ago is being solved now because of it. I’m sure he never, ever expected to be picked up on it. Prisons are built for people like this.
@Really
…Really?!?!?!?! So the dishonorable discharge, the time in Leavenworth for arson, the assault conviction and now suspect in a double murder, and you still think this guy is awesome? You’ve got to be a friend, relative or mental incompetent to not at least think that there may be some possibility that this guy may have some serious, serious issues.
I personally don’t associate with arsonists or suspected murderers, but that’s just me. I tend to worry you get on the wrong side of someone like that, they burn down yer house or want to bust your head. Once again, just my opinion.
wow it’s funny how the writers are willing to give this guy the benefit of the doubt but it was guilty off the back for Berry and Battiste and they had to prove themselves innocent even when there was no evidence that pointed towards them to support the charges against them. but yet this guy’s blood was found at the sceen mixed with the victims blood and he still is being considered innocent but dna does not lie they the informants and so called witnesses do.",What evidence led to Mosley's arrest for the murders?,"Mosley's DNA, which was recovered at the crime scene, led to his arrest for the murders. His DNA had been entered in a state database and compared with DNA from unsolved crimes."
"Signor Sassi is a London institution that has been around since 1984, from 2007 the ownership belonged to the San Carlo Group. It ruffles up the sort of Italian food that ‘Mama’ used to make, comforting, simple, classic, wholesome and above all pretty damn tasty. Format wise, there are two narrow dining spaces as you walk in, warmly hued with dimmed lights, white table clothes, tiled floors and walls peppered with ‘A’ to ‘Z’ listed celeb’s photos. It’s a vibrant place full of well heeled folk, with suited waiters buzzing around, navigating through the tapered gaps between tables, doing their thing. If you’re lucky, they’ll congregate and sing you a melody! You might get better Italian fare elsewhere, but this London institution tucked away in Knightsbridge Green is worth checking out.
The walls are decorated with famous faces who have dined here.
Looks like quite a few well heeled folk eat here.
What better way is there to start a meal than bread? I tried the brown variety – not making me want to go back for seconds but it was decent enough. It’s complimentary as is the parmesan and olives.
There is something about this parmesan that makes me keep going back for more – your mouth is filled with its savoury umami nuttiness – it was simply addictive.
These olives are beautiful to look at and to taste – I preferred the green ones.
The menus are extensive to say the least, they are split across the ‘specials’ which has more dishes than a John Lewis department store. There’s also their standard menu, the ‘chefs specials’ and your obligatory ‘in season’ truffle menu.
There’s even a bit of Kobe in their chef’s specials – I’m not sure how legit their license is!
Every day we’re trufflin’!
Things were kicked off with this Primitivo Di Manduria – it was very juicy, full bodied with a long finish.
Tomato Bruschetta also complimentary and a very tasty appetiser. The biscuit-like toasted bread was the perfect vehicle to carry those sweet chopped tomatoes, which are seasoned with basil and olive oil.
Gamberoni Gorgonzola (£12.95). Yes that’s right, tiger prawns with gorgonzola cheese. The prawns were cooked beautifully, translucent and juicy. However, the dish belongs in the weird pile for me. Cheese is just a plain ‘NO’ with prawns, and that Thai style sweet chilli sauce only adds to the clash.
Zitonni Toscanini (£14.80). ‘Long pasta tubes, favourite of the Maestro Toscanini, made with Tuscan spiced sausage, extra virgin olive oil, fresh tomatoes & Tuscan percorino’. This dish was designed to be eaten with a full bodied Italian red, there’s definitely not delicate flavour here – you get the sharp tang of the tomatoes and the robust smokey spicy sausage, all nestled into those al dente tubes of deliciousness. My slight quibble though is that the presentation could have been tighter.
Spaghetti lobster (£26). Sweet, sweet lobster at one with the al dente spaghetti. Cooking with the shell, is obviously conducive of more flavour too. It’s a winner. My only gripe is that at a £26 price point there needs to be more lobster.
Capesante al forno (£23.50). Fresh scallops drizzled with lemon, olive oil, parsley, garlic. Baked with bread crumbs. I didn’t get to taste this one sadly.
Abbacchio Lagure (£17.90). Baked rack of lamb with red wine & mixed herbs. A perfect pink in the middle and tender as can be. Visually, it was a thing to behold.
Let’s not forget the sides now, as they are worthy of a mention. First up is spinach sauté (£3.35) with garlic, chilli and Worchester Sauce. Spinach can be a dark art to cook as it holds a lot of water – I mean come on let’s be honest and say who likes watery spinach? Not here though, it was pitch perfect, full of flavour and a must have.
Fried courgettes (£3.35) came crisp with a light batter, just enough to cover those sweet slithers of courgette. I didn’t stop until they were all gone!
An extra special mention needs to go to our maitre’d ‘Dino’. He knew the extensive menu like the back of his hand, likewise for the wines & their particular regions. His charm and slick service enhanced our meal no end.
The verdict:
When did I go? Nov 2015
The damage: Expect to pay £65-£80 per head with wine.
The good: Classic Italian cooking with old school Italian charm, Dino was on point. It’s particularly entertaining when all the waiters congregate and sing! The must haves include the lobster spaghetti (you can’t beat the classics) as are spinach and courgette sides.
The bad: I was too full for desert and the menus is far too busy. Avoid the prawns with gorgonzola.

"A Twitter user has discovered that Microsoft might be getting ready to “kill” the File History backup tool when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update arrives. According to a tweet by WalkingCat, the Windows 10 build 16212 which Microsoft accidentally released a few days ago, doesn’t include the backup feature.
Specifically, the Twitter user notices that making new backups with File History is no longer supported. This could mean that Microsoft might be ready to completely remove the feature with the upcoming Fall Creators Update.
As mentioned above, the File History Backup Tool has been around since Windows 8. Microsoft introduced the feature with the famous OS back in 2012. File History allows users to backup incremental revisions of files and then restore them from a secondary storage device.
Of course, Microsoft updated File History in Windows 10. However, it seems like the company has something else in mind for backup once the Fall Creators Update drops.
New backup option and alternatives
Without a doubt, Microsoft will provide a backup option for Windows 10. Until the company confirms the removal of File History, users can still benefit from it.
As for the future, those in doubt can also create backups in Windows 10 using third-party software. There are a lot of options available for that, but it goes without saying that Microsoft will want to offer a built-in solution for Windows 10.
With the Windows 10 build 16212 already available due to an accidental release, it is possible we will have more information in this regard soon.
Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, said that no new builds would be coming this week, so expect a new release in just a few days.",What is the speculation about the File History backup tool in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update?,"The speculation is that Microsoft might be getting ready to “kill” the File History backup tool when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update arrives. This is based on the observation that the Windows 10 build 16212, which Microsoft accidentally released, doesn’t include the backup feature."
"On Mar. 21, the American Medical Association (AMA), along with dozens of other industry leaders, delivered an open letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), asking for an Administrative Burden category for exemptions to MACRA penalties.
The letter stated that current reporting programs are inadequate to keep up with the quality reporting requirements of MACRA and the 21st Century Cures Act. The signers of the letter believe that the administrative burdens of the newly implemented requirements are too overwhelming to fully comply with by Mar. 31, 2018.
What are these organizations asking for?
The letter specifically addresses meaningful use (MU), the physician quality reporting system (PQRS) and value-based payment modifiers (VM). In 2017, organizations need to provide a minimum amount of reporting data in order to avoid negative payment adjustments in 2019. To qualify for positive payment adjustments, organizations must meet specific reporting goals as laid out by CMS.
“Oct. 2, 2017 is the deadline for starting to collect data.”
Currently, organizations have until Oct. 2, 2017 to begin sending data to CMS. Reports must cover at least 90 days. Failing to submit the minimum amount of data by the 2018 deadline may result in a negative payment adjustment.
“Consequently, we urge the Administration to take a series of steps to address these same challenges in MU, PQRS and VM prior to their replacement by MACRA and minimize the penalties assessed for physicians who tried to participate in these programs,” stated the letter.
Physicians lacking the necessary reporting systems struggle to produce reports that meet CMS standards, increasing the risk of future penalties.
CMS has yet to formally respond to the request for an Administrative Burden exemption.
How can organizations make reporting improvements today?
Unfortunately, organizations cannot wait long for a response. Time is rapidly ticking down to the Oct. 2 deadline for beginning the reporting process. Waiting for an exemption that may never come will only drive up risk. Organizations with thin profit margins cannot face that kind of risk, which means it’s time to start developing a plan of action.
Investing in reporting solutions today could help organizations avoid Medicare penalties in the future. The formula is simple:
Improve your reporting platform today, protect – and possibly augment – your revenue in 2019.
If you’re worried about future penalties, the easiest step to take is to find an affordable way to submit the bare minimum reporting data in 2017. According to CMS, providing 90 days of data for a single quality measure or improvement activity is enough to avoid penalties and may even garner a positive adjustment.
Example: Care transition documentation practice improvements
One of the many improvement activities organizations may submit data for is improving documentation of care transition. This activity requires MIPS-qualified providers to document how they carried out a patient-centered action plan for the first 30 days following a discharge. These activities may include phone calls, home visits and providing patients information.
Organizations with customized technology solutions can complete this task easily by pulling data from a patient engagement system into a report they would then forward to CMS. Doing so not only helps organizations avoid penalties, but also improves patient engagement.
Even if CMS implements the Administrative Burden, the exemption wouldn’t stop penalization – it would only push penalties back further. The best solution is to invest in reporting solutions today so that you can get the highest positive payment adjustment in the future. By 2022, organizations stand to gain up to a 9 percent increase in payment adjustments from CMS.",What are the American Medical Association and other industry leaders requesting from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid?,"The American Medical Association and other industry leaders are requesting an Administrative Burden category for exemptions to MACRA penalties from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.

"As a historian with specific interest in Agriculture and Economy, I have over the years focused on trying to proffer solutions to socio-economic problems confronting the Nigerian society in particular and the African continent in general. As a result much of my research works and publications have focused on issues like Land Management, Climate Change, Migration, Conflict, Crop production and marketing. Studies have also been done in areas of Ethno-Religious Conflict with focus on role of economy and governance, the Almajarai system and economic implications in Nigeria and Poverty and Terrorism. Some of these research outputs have been published as articles in reputable local and off-shore journals such as West Bohemian Historical Review, Developing Countries Studies, Modern Africa, Journal of Asian and African Studies and Historical Yearbook as well as chapters in books. These works have been able to impact not only on the academic community but also on the larger Nigerian Community and as such I have been at various times privileged to address much larger audience, both at intellectual and participatory levels. For instance, in 2010, I was invited by the Pan Igala Renaissance to speak on Trade and Commerce along the River Niger Basin. I have also worked with Center for Public Policy and Inter-religious Affairs on issues relating the socio-economic problems and possible solutions in Northern Nigeria. The work on Terrorism and its Implication on Infrastructure and Economic Development: A Review of Selected Cases across the Country since c.1980 published by Africa and Science, Germany, led to the body through her editor Moses Chi, requesting that I collaborate with one of their research who was then at the level of framework of research program on terrorism in Nigeria and Cameroun in 2015. The result of this led to my completion and subsequent publication of “Poverty and Terrorism in Northern Nigeria: Some Reflective notes on the manipulation of the almajirai System and its implication on National Development” in Modern Africa, Czech 2016 and “Emerging Religious Movements and its Implications for African History and Heritage”; European Scientific Journal, Republic of Macedonia 2016. In 2016, through my contribution in the area of intergroup relations, I was appointed member of the Study Committee on Inter-religious Affairs, Universal Peace Federation, West Africa and Nation Agricultural Production Cooperative Union of Nigeria (NAPCON). My research on the Economy, Minorities and Poverty in Northern Nigeria with specific reference to the Maguzawa and Nigeria citizenship: Reflecting on Identity Politics and National Question in Africa caught the attention of Nigerian Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAN) through which i was consulted to help work on Environment and Social Impact Assessment Study of Flood and Erosion, Northeastern Nigeria. I have consulted for the Kukah Centre Abuja, on Intergroup Relations, Conflict Prevention and Management in the Southern Kaduna area of Nigeria focusing on Economic Impact/Implications. I have also consulted for The Catholic Poverty Reduction Group in the area of History of the Marginalized Indigenous groups in Northern Nigeria. I am also a Resource Person and Contributor to the Nigerian History Project (NHP), a Centre under the auspices of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Foundation (OOPLF) for research, documentation and curation of galleries based on selected historical themes or events in Nigeria. As a way of mentoring, apart from my primary assignment in the University, I teach history as part of Community Development Project to pupils of Sunshine Primary School, Ile-Ife. I also reach out to the larger community through analysis on radio (Matters Arising on Odua FM 90.9 Ile-Ife and Crunch Time on Crown FM 101.5,Ile-Ife), articles and news in Independence Newspaper, Ibadan, Katolink Paper, Osogbo; The Olivebranch Newspaper, Zaria; The Cross News, Kaduna and The Caritas, Bauchi.",What are some of the socio-economic issues the historian has focused their research on in relation to Nigeria and Africa?,"The historian has focused their research on issues like Land Management, Climate Change, Migration, Conflict, Crop production and marketing, Ethno-Religious Conflict with focus on role of economy and governance, the Almajarai system and economic implications in Nigeria and Poverty and Terrorism."
"Friday Round-up (10/2/20): Key Industry Players Pledge to Reduce Food Waste
Every week FoodLogiQ will be aggregating the latest updates and resources for businesses navigating the changing food industry. Learn how the industry leaders are adapting to protect and feed consumers, while building resilience in the face of global crisis.
Numerous news outlets have been reporting on major food companies pledging to cut their food waste in half by 2030 as part of the 10x20x30 initiative. The aggressive goal has brought nearly 200 suppliers to the table, including Ahold Delhaize, Walmart, Kroger, Mondelez, Nestlé, PepsiCo and General Mills, according to the Food Dive.
The initiative aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions within the food industry, which food waste contributes to significantly. “According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, about 30 percent of the world’s food is unharvested or thrown away at various points in the supply chain. And all that loss is a big contributor to climate change, accounting for 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,” the Washington Post reported in an article about the initiative.
Consumer demand for sustainability products has also been a major driver for food brands setting public transparency and sustainability goals. Nearly half of consumers are swayed by sustainability factors in purchasing behavior, and over 60% of consumers are influenced by whether or not they trust a brand, according to research by Nielsen. NYU has also published findings that sustainability marketed products are responsible for over half growth in the CPG space across categories.
Some companies are responding to consumer demand by setting broader sustainability goals across their supply chain. General Mills announced on September 21st, 2020 “a pledge to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent across its full value chain – from farm to fork to landfill – over the next 10 years.” With major companies paving the way, new industry standards for sustainability and transparency will only continue to accelerate.
Ultimately, however, the food industry will need to evolve core data management practices to feasibility reduce food waste at scale, properly impact consumer behavior, as well as accurately track progress towards these ambitious goals. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published recommendations across marketing, data labeling and applying research and technology for reducing food waste. According to the organization, the report “recommends industry, consumers, and nonprofits all advocate for federal legislation to standardize date labeling on packaged food”. Such advancements will help triage food waste from the farm to fridge, an essential step in addressing the environmental impacts of the global food industry.

Review: Raised From the Ground
3.5 Stars - Recommended to fans of historic epic family stories / Not recommended as an intro to the author
Pgs: 363
Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
Released: Dec'12
The more I read Jose Saramago's earlier works, the more I appreciate his distinctive writing style. Originally written in his native language in 1980, Saramago's posthumously translated Raised From the Ground gives us a glimpse of the conversational, long-flowing sentences and creative characterization that become commonplace in his later fiction.
In this, the author's most personal novel, Saramago tells the story of three generations of Mau Tempo's - a hard working, illiterate, and landless family - in a fascinating and wholly engaging way. Forget reading a book about the things that happen to this growing family of peasants who work their knuckles to the bone out in the fields of Alentejo in order to keep food on their plates and a roof over their head. Instead, find yourself pulled through the pages by the narrator as he sits besides you and decadently deviates from the tale of these unfortunate grandparents and daughters and sons from time to time, zooming in among the pebbles on the path that our Mau Tempo's walk to show us the thin line of ants who parade alongside these humans on their very own survival mission, and drawing our focus towards the dribble of water that spills from a bucket, contemplating the liquid's fate as members of the Mau Tempo family fight to see another day.
A story of perseverance in the face of public humiliation and political punishment, Saramago's strong feelings for church and government dance in the background as he dazzles us with the simple strength of human will. In a time when standing up for your rights found you jailed and tortured, we are urged to watch as generation after generation of the Mau Tempo men attempt to make a better living for their families.
Saramago and his crafty narrator find the perfect balance between satire and sadness, where elements of history and humor mix together expertly to keep the tears from forming in your eyes as you root for the hardy farm workers to finally get their day in the sun.
I found the novel to be somewhat long in the tooth - the ponderous deviations that I look forward to in Saramago's later novels are still figuring themselves out here, sometimes appearing at the wrong moment, other times deviating so far off the story's path that it actually slows the tale's momentum rather than enhance it. Yet as I say that, Saramago also manages moments of sheer perfection as his mind strays from the story - most often in the form of an additional perspective during events that are taking place. Our narrator has no qualms stepping back and allowing another to tell the goings-on when the opportunity arises. Take for instance this thin line of ants that happen to find themselves in the path of one of the Mau Tempo men as they fall to the ground from a beating. Our narrator allows the lead ant, which holds its head like a dog, to share what it is seeing in that very moment, how it observes and makes note of the man's bruised and battered face, a face it shall never forget, before the ant moves on to wherever he and his friends were headed. And later in the story, we are treated again to their perspective, when this same line of ants find themselves moving along the walls of the prison that the battered man is being held and tortured in...
A moving tale that demonstrates the cunning and creative beginnings of a wickedly talented Nobel-laureate novelist.
Great review. Intrigued, particularly about the ant becoming the narrator.","What is the main theme of Jose Saramago's novel ""Raised From the Ground""?","The main theme of Jose Saramago's novel ""Raised From the Ground"" is the story of three generations of Mau Tempo's - a hard working, illiterate, and landless family - and their perseverance in the face of public humiliation and political punishment."
"At Davos, rising income inequality worries some billionaires too(Read article summary)
Some 2,500 of the world's elite descended upon Davos, Switzerland for the 45th World Economic Forum. What was on their minds?
Laurent Gillieron/AP
(Read caption) German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, speaks next to German Klaus Schwab, right, founder and president of the World Economic Forum, WEF, during a panel session of the 45th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, WEF, in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday. The meeting runs from Jan. 21 through Jan. 24.
What is there to discuss when you're in a ski lodge at Davos amongst a handful of the most powerful people in the world?
Does one ask Pharrell Williams about his role as a coach on ""The Voice""? Or perhaps query Egyptian leader Gen. Abdel Sisi if he is partial to alpine or cross country skiing?
They are both among the 2,500 people at the 45th Annual World Economic Forum where industry leaders, politicians, diplomats, philanthropists, and artists discuss world trade and other pressing global issues. Williams is in attendance with former Vice President Al Gore to promote their Live Earth 2015 Concert to raise awareness for climate change. Mr. Sisi is taking in the forum as an unofficial coming-out party in front of leaders of multinational organizations and other governments, according to the Guardian.
And a least one American billionaire was in Davos this week to talk about an unstable future if the economy is not restructured. Jeff Greene, who amassed his fortune in the US real estate market, raised concerns about low-paying American jobs when he spoke at the World Economic Forum, according to Bloomberg.
Mr. Greene warned that the United States faces an unprecedented job crisis that will cause social unrest and could spur a major change in American politics. “I’m remarkably long for my level of pessimism,” he told Bloomberg. “Our economy is in deep trouble. We need to be honest with ourselves. We’ve had a realistic level of job destruction, and those jobs aren’t coming back.”
Greene went onto say that even if some jobs that were outsourced made it back to US shores, they would likely be performed by robots or computer programs.
This year's gathering in the Swiss alps comes at a time when income inequality has reached its highest levels ever. An Oxfam report says that 80 people now control as much wealth as 3.5 billion people, or about half the world's population. The Oxfam report concluded that if current trends continue, the top one percent of the world's earners will own more wealth than the other 99 percent by next year.
The world's elite arrived in Switzerland in some 1,500 private jets, according to CNN, to discuss slow global growth that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned could cause great social upheaval in the coming years.
The IMF pointed to China's growth slowing and the sharp drop in oil prices that could pull Russia into a deep recession as indicators that global output will decline, according to the Guardian. The forum comes at a time when less than half of the global population trusts their governments, according to the Edelman Trust barometer.
But even as the American and European middle class erodes, consistent and brisk economic growth elsewhere in the world is creating a higher standard of living and a new global middle class is taking form, according to a report from Reuters. By the year 2030, 4.9 billion people will make up this new middle class, up from 2 billion today.
The swell of the global middle is attributed to the expectation that hundreds of millions of Indians and Chinese will be lifted out of poverty in the next 20 years, according to the Reuters projection.
The Davos gathering concludes today.","What was the main concern of American billionaire Jeff Greene at the 45th World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland?",Jeff Greene's main concern at the 45th World Economic Forum was about an unstable future if the economy is not restructured. He raised concerns about low-paying American jobs and warned that the United States faces an unprecedented job crisis that will cause social unrest and could spur a major change in American politics.

"Nowadays more and more urban residents want to slightly separate themselves from all the negative aspects of big-city life, thus deciding to buy a flat or an apartment located in a gated community. The middle and upper classes chose this new lifestyle, which affirmed their social status and created a differentiated space. However, this choice should be carefully thought out beforehand, as it has both advantages and disadvantages.
Everything at your fingertips
Regarding the tranquillity, gated communities are usually located in the outskirts of the cities, so they allow to escape from noise and traffic. Their planning is often accompanied by a projection about the growth of nearby neighbourhoods, in addition to the incorporation of amenities specific to the urbanisation. In this way, it becomes less and less necessary to travel to the centre since everything required, such as pharmacies, shops, banks, is nearby.
Gated Communities: are they only for the rich?
Gated communities have always aroused much controversy. At one time, they were perceived as luxury accommodation, intended only for the prosperous. Thus, they gave a kind of prestige to the residents who were separated from the rest of society. However, nowadays, this border has begun to blur, and a less wealthy citizen can also afford an apartment located within a closed community. Due to the high interest in this type of housing, development companies compete with each other, offering more and more attractive offers.
Advantages of closed settlements
Safety
The definite advantage of a gated community is a lower risk of theft, burglary or occurrence of acts of vandalism as in the case of open urban space. 24-hour monitoring ensures comfort for residents and, most importantly, gives a sense of security. Thanks to this, maintaining order and aesthetic appearance of the place of residence is much easier and more effective.
Recreational areas
Another advantage of this type of building is specially separated, attractive recreational areas, designed for residents who want to relax after a hard day, not far from the place of residence. Thus, closed facilities often include amenities such as playgrounds, a leisure zone with benches, a picnic area, and barbecue areas favouring the integration of neighbours. Private access makes all the difference. These are just a few primary attractions. Many of the housing investments include access to various types of educational, service, banking or medical aid in the estate itself.
Less car traffic
A significant advantage is also the lack of heavy car traffic near the community. Often in the case of such buildings, underground parking is provided. In this situation, the car traffic takes place only in a strictly defined zone, which is a massive advantage for parents with children who can be sure that their children can play in the open air safely.
Disadvantages of a gated community
Social divisions
Unfortunately, closed communities also have some disadvantages. One of them is undeniably the risk of creating social divisions. Because for many people, gated communities have become a synonym of prestige, people from the outside can be automatically perceived as worse and less affluent. It is also worth noting that these divisions can also be seen among the residents of the gated community, who are not always a harmonious community, but rather a group of anonymous people. What’s more, isolation from the outside world is bad for our mental health. Therefore, it is essential to cultivate relations with our neighbours and not let life end up in a way that would harm us.
Less privacy
The lack of privacy is also a disadvantage to closed housing estates, which is a side effect of 24-hour security. Besides, in individual cases, visits to residents may be somewhat tricky. The administration of some settlements requires the verification of the identity of people entering its area, and the real implementation of this procedure can generate many problems.
It is also worth emphasising that the safety of residents is sometimes only apparent. Despite the measures taken, such as 24-hour monitoring and hiring a security company, criminal acts also occur in closed housing estates. It is impossible to eliminate them completely.
Conclusion
As you can see, there are pros and cons of living in a gated community. That is why the decision about choosing such a way of living should be well thought out.
Be the first to comment on ""The Pros and Cons of Living in a Gated Community""",What are some advantages and disadvantages of living in a gated community?,"Some advantages of living in a gated community include tranquility due to their location in the outskirts of cities, availability of amenities nearby, lower risk of theft or vandalism due to 24-hour monitoring, attractive recreational areas, and less car traffic. However, the disadvantages include the risk of creating social divisions, less privacy due to 24-hour security, and the potential for criminal acts despite security measures."
"Podding across Europe!
Posted on
Jayne & Godfrey Wilkinson collected their Go-Pod from Red Lion on the 2nd August 2019 - and then set straight off on an epic road trip across Europe! This is what they said;
We picked up our new Go-Pod on 2nd August 2019.
We then travelled for a month across Europe, staying in the Go-Pod on a number of campsites in France, Switzerland and Italy, to our final destination on 31st August, the Mani, in the Peloponnese, Greece.
We travelled a total of 3158 km (1963 miles), it was a great trip and the perfect way to travel.

"A trip to the City Ground awaits for our upcoming fixture, an away EFL Cup clash with Championship side Nottingham Forest.
Considering our convincing 4-1 away win on Saturday, as well as the number of experienced youngsters left out of the matchday squad to face Everton’s u23’s on Monday, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a number of them feature in some capacity against Philippe Montainer’s side. Even still, Forest have the potential to pose a number of problems, not least the home advantage they will experience at a sold-out stadium.
Team news
Although there are no new fresh injury doubts for Arsène Wenger to factor into his starting XI, Gabriel (knee) could feature at some stage after recovering from the nasty-looking injury he suffered in our final pre-season friendly before the campaign began early in August.
Rob Holding, who hasn’t featured since Shkodran Mustafi’s arrival, could start alongside the Brazilian if he is passed fit to play but the general consensus is that Wenger will use a second-string side with a rotational mix of youth and experience.
Aaron Ramsey (hamstring) and Olivier Giroud (toe) have minor issues, so should be ready to feature in some capacity with Antonio Conte’s Chelsea side making the short trip to north London on Saturday in the Premier League.
Kieran Gibbs and Jeff Reine-Adelaide could be in line for their first senior starts of the season, along with 20-year-old forward Chuba Akpom too.
Possible XI (4-2-3-1): Ospina; Bellerín, Holding, Gabriel, Gibbs; Elneny, Xhaka; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Reine-Adelaide, Perez; Akpom.
The opposition
As the underdogs in this cup tie, Forest will relish the opportunity to test their credentials against one of the best sides in Europe.
First-team manager Philippe Montainer was full of praise for us in the pre-match press conference, and said it’d be “a great achievement” for them to prevail and consequently progress into the last-32.
“It’s exciting to be playing against one of Europe’s biggest clubs. The stadium is sold out and we’re going to need every one of our fans tomorrow night because it will be a very tough challenge.”
The 51-year-old, appointed this summer, also had plenty of praise for Wenger with his 20-year anniversary as Arsenal boss this week.
“Arsenal have always had great stability and bring through talented players who play in the same style. Arsene Wenger is a very good example for French managers and he sets the standard for those of us working in Europe.”
Nicklas Bendtner’s fitness has improved quickly since arriving at the Championship outfit and he’ll be ready for a potential start against his former employers.
Britt Assombalonga, Damien Perquis and Thomas Lam are all unavailable for selection through respective knocks, as confirmed by Montainer himself but even still, Forest have enough quality in their ranks to pose plenty of questions for Arsenal’s backline.
Amongst them is versatile Hildeberto Pereira, who is on a season-long loan deal from Benfica. The 20-year-old is a right-winger who can also double up in a more defensive right-back position, as well as doing an effective job playing as a striker too. There is an option to buy in his current contract deal with Forest and based on his performances thus far, they’ll be eager to activate the clause at the end of the season.
Possible XI (4-3-3): Stojkovic; Lichaj, Mills, Mancienne, Fox; Cohen, Kasami, Lansbury; Carayol, Pereira, Bendtner.
Having suffered a defeat against lesser opposition in the fourth round last season, Forest pose similar threats that Sheffield Wednesday did and if we struggle to get off to a promising start, there’s no doubt we’ll potentially be in for a long evening.",Who could potentially start alongside Gabriel if he is passed fit to play in the upcoming EFL Cup clash with Nottingham Forest?,Rob Holding could potentially start alongside Gabriel if he is passed fit to play in the upcoming EFL Cup clash with Nottingham Forest.
"Speaking of yesterday’s discussion of Cybermen and The Borg, another well known borg sci-fi character was the subject of a New York Times article this week: RoboCop is being resurrected for the big screen this year, one of several remakes of 1980s properties, such as 21 Jump Street and Dirty Dancing, coming soon to a theater near you.
Unfortunately there is not much information yet released, especially no photos yet of the police uniform for the 2013 RoboCop production. Peter Weller, who we learned this year will be featured in the next Star Trek movie, originally dawned the steel armor of the downed cop who, like the Bionic Man, was rebuilt to fight the forces of evil in the U.S. The original costume is instantly recognizable, but early word from production is that we will see a very different police armor uniform for the new RoboCop.
Although it is not quite as cool as the original RoboCop, I am a fan of the Iowa State Patrol uniform worn by the officer hunting down a young James T. Kirk in the future Riverside, Iowa in Star Trek 2009:
I’m still not sure if that was a good protective outfit for a human cop, or whether that android face mask reflects an actual android, or this was meant to be a cyborg creation. Either way, it’s a pretty good outfit.
Years ago Academy Award winners Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock showed us the prim and proper cops of the future city of San Angeles, where we learned “In the future, all restaurants are Taco Bell.”
My fellow Trekkies will recognize those belts being re-used in the Mirror Universe of the Enterprise TV series by evil Captain Archer & Co. These guys looked believable. But no armor!
And this year’s coming remake of Total Recall features another slick looking future cop:
Note that the new Total Recall takes no obvious design queues from Paul Verhoeven’s original Total Recall. So it should be no surprise if the new RoboCop takes no design queues from Verhoeven’s RoboCop. Verhoeven’s RoboCop was inspired by the future cop from the comic book 2000 A.D., Judge Dredd, and Verhoeven’s RoboCop has been interpreted as a retelling of sorts of the original Judge Dredd story because of several common themes, and, of course, the mask. Although the Sylvester Stallone future cop in Judge Dredd didn’t adhere totally to the original story, he did have a mask, but his uniform was a bit strange:
Future cops are definitely “in” these days. Karl Urban (Bones in Star Trek 2009, Eomer in Lord of the Rings, Xena, Bourne Supremacy, Chronicles of Riddick) will be starring in a new version of Judge Dredd, that Urban says comes more from the course material, titled Dredd and expected to be released in September 2012.
Far less interesting are the precrime future cop uniforms from Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report, based on Philip K. Dick’s short story of the same name:
For the new RoboCop, José Padilha is slated to direct a screenplay by Nick Schenk and Joshua Zetumer. Thirty-three year old actor Joel Kinnaman has been tapped for the lead role as Murphy/RoboCop. Of the creative trio, Schenk is the best known for his sceenplay for Clint Eastwood’s (awesome) film, Gran Torino. Kinnaman had a small role in last year’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and as Stephen Holder in the TV series, The Killing.
Here is the the marketing blurb for the new film: “In a crime-ridden city, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg with submerged memories haunting him.”
Padilha and Kinnaman have disclosed thus far that the new RoboCop will be a very different film than the original, with a costume where you can see the RoboCop’s eyes, and they’d said that the focus of the new story will be the period from Murphy getting shot to becoming RoboCop, as opposed to an action film where RoboCop serves as a futuristic officer. So this seems a bit like the path of Martin Caidin’s original Bionic Man story as told in his novel Cyborg.
My favorite scene, and the one I hope they do include in some way, is the scene where the non-cyborg RoboCop before Weller’s is revealed to be flawed and destroys one of the executives in the board room at the big reveal.
The current release date is scheduled for August 9, 2013.

"The leading health and beauty retailer in Ukraine is leveraging Infor WMS to increase efficiency and enable its growth. Eva operates more than 990 stores across the country, employing more than 11,000 people. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, EVA has bullish expansion plans. It was looking to open 150 new stores and increase its distribution centres from four to six, increasing available space by 25%. It also looked to expand its eCommerce SKUs to 150,000 and 40,000 for its stores. Each day it estimates it would pick 350,000 orders in 2020 within each distribution centre.
Déjà vu on the challenge
Founded in 2002, by 2011 Eva had 144 stores. By then IT systems in the distribution centre were running slowly, causing a delay in supplying its stores. It had been using EXXceed WMS since 2007 and looked around for a consultancy firm that might help with its review. It worked with LT Management and they helped to improve business processes as well as upgrading both systems and software. As a result of the improvements, LT Management became its partner of choice and it signed a support agreement in late 2011.
Roll forward to 2016 and with more distribution centres in place and more retail stores the systems were starting to creak again. Eva was a victim of its own success. Its processes, once efficient in a smaller operation, were no longer fit for purpose and caused an issue with processing times. An example of this was the picking process itself. The process used would check stock availability, reserving stock for each order. A second stage would then issue picking lists for each worker to physically pick the stock.
The latest challenge
It became clear that Eva needed to improve the solution. It wanted to implement modern picking technology and integrate the solution both to its existing EEP and the Qlever Intralogistics conveyor and equipment management system and the control module it uses.
Enterprise Times asked Konstantin Tverdokhlib, Director Of Sales Marketing at LT Management about the challenges faced by Eva. Eva decided to review the WMS market and looked at several solutions including:
It chose to deploy the latest generation of Infor WMS, version 11 and worked with LT Management to deploy the new solution. Enterprise Times asked Tverdokhlib why Infor own the contract. He replied: “Performance, easy integration, vendor-independent (zero coding) adjustment ability (user interfaces, reports, business process etc.)”
The solution
Eva chose to deploy a WMS solution within each distribution centre. There are several reasons for this. Infor does not offer a cloud solution yet to the CIS region. According to Tverdokhlib, there is little demand for this outside the major cities as connectivity often fails. Tverdokhlib noted: “There are still some connectivity issues in our region, and warehouses are obviously located outside of major cities. In the case where connection fails, a warehouse becomes inoperable and no shipments can be done. That is unacceptable.”
This meant that Eva implemented five different WMS solutions, each connecting back to their central ERP in a hub and spoke architecture. This also means that the workload is distributed and only processes the local requirement. The WMS solutions do not interact with each other, only via the central ERP solution. This increases resiliency and ensures that should one system fail, then the other distribution centres continue to function.
As for the modern warehouse technology that the WMS integrates to, Tverdokhlib commented: “mainly they use Honeywell Dolphin 70+ ring scanner HW86xx for the picking. There are some Intermec RF Guns.”
The system is used by 450 staff already and will expand this year to 680. Dmitry Martynov, Infor’s official representative in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) commented: “The architecture of Infor’s warehouse management solutions helps companies seamlessly grow and scale their capacity. In any situation (increasing order volume, product range expansion, increasing number of stores, etc.), the solutions will work stably and reliably, meeting all the requirements of the business.”
The results
Now implemented, Eva has tracked improvements to its operation between 2018 and 2019. Some of the statistics are impressive.
- A four-fold reduction in the number of errors in order picking.
- A reduction in the number of complaints from 0.14% to 0.04% of the total volume of orders.
- A 20% productivity increase in order picking.
- Elimination of paper-based processes.
These results coupled with changes to business processes have yet again improved the efficiency of the Eva operations. It is now prepared for its next leap in growth. That growth continued in 2020 with the opening of five stores in Marchin Karkov, Nikolaev, Khmelnitsky, Bolgrad and Novgorod-Seversky. The stores continue to operate as Eva sells Hygiene products. It has undertaken to conduct temperature checks for all staff at the beginning of each day in every store and distribution centre. A measure designed to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Denis Zakora, EVA’s warehouse logistics manager commented: “Thanks to the capabilities of Infor WMS and the experience of LT-Management, we were able to implement all the best business practices used in modern distribution centres. We transitioned seamlessly to modern working methods and technologies, and now we can maintain high-growth rates that are not limited by the capabilities of the warehouse system. Despite the industrial status of Infor WMS, this system allows our company to introduce new processes and independently open new warehouses.”
Enterprise Times: What does this mean
The importance of expert partners is the key message of this story. LT Management has worked with and clearly understand the Eva business deeply. Its expertise with the Infor platform and the ability to implement the solution in a way that was not disruptive. It also improved business practices simultaneously, which is impressive.
Oleg Landyshev, project manager of LT-Management commented: “During the implementation of Infor WMS in the distribution centres of the EVA chain, the LT-Management team addressed all the needs of the customer. The company expertly performed the implementation process and integration with corporate systems. As a result, the Infor WMS solution has provided the distribution centres with the all-new technical capabilities necessary for their growth.”
In some countries, the cloud is not yet the answer for all organisations. Infor has proven that its ability to deploy its solutions, both in the cloud and on-premises, benefits many of these customers.

"Fresh on the heels of an Empire Center report that said that Riverhead Police salaries are 30 percent higher than the state average, and a Newsday report that ranked Riverhead’s police chief as the highest paid employee in Suffolk County in 2014, Riverhead Councilman John Dunleavy is calling for a salary increase for some employees on Howell Avenue: himself and the rest of the Town Board.
At Thursday’s Town Board work session, Mr. Dunleavy submitted a draft resolution that calls for all elected officials in the town to get a cost of living increase annually in an amount not less than the Consumer Price Index.
These salary increases would be effective for 2017.
“Where the heck did this come from?” Supervisor Sean Walter asked as he read the resolution.
“It came from me,” Mr. Dunleavy said. He added that Town Board members have not received a raise in six years.
“Everybody says this is the poorest town in Suffolk County or on Long Island, yet our supervisor is the highest paid supervisor in Suffolk County,” Mr. Dunleavy said.
“No, I’m not,” responded Mr. Walter, whose annual salary as supervisor is $115,148.
Mr. Dunleavy then produced a list of Long Island supervisors and mayors and their salaries from Monday’s Newsday article — though missed the fact that Huntington Supervisor Frank Petrone surpassed Mr. Walter’s salary.
“I didn’t set my salary,” Mr. Walter said.
Mr. Dunleavy said Riverhead has the lowest paid council members.
“Well, I’ll vote against it,” Mr. Walter said of the resolution calling for annual raises. “If you can get three votes (on the Town Board), go ahead.”
The supervisor said Riverhead doesn’t have the lowest paid council members either, citing Southold Town.
Southold has Town Trustees who make about $19,000 and town Council members who make about $34,000. Mr. Dunleavy said Riverhead’s board members handle the functions of both a councilperson and a Trustee.
Riverhead’s council members earn $48,955, although Councilwoman Jodi Giglio makes $47,598 because she declined to take a raise several years ago. Town Board positions are technically part-time jobs, while the role of supervisor is a full-time one.
A quick check of 2016 budgets of Long Island towns shows that two other towns pay their council members less than Riverhead.
Southold Council members make $34,390 per year and Shelter Island’s make $37,704.
The highest is Islip, at $77,200.
Mr. Dunleavy said board members can refuse the raise if they don’t want it.
Councilman Jim Wooten was the only other board member present Thursday, as Ms. Giglio and Councilman George Gabrielsen were absent. He said, “that gallon of milk and loaf of bread costs more than it did eight years ago, yet you’re taking on the same money … I’m just saying, I can understand why legislators do that.”
“Do you think we deserve it?” Mr. Walter asked Mr. Dunleavy.
“I think we deserve it,” Mr. Dunleavy responded. “Some people are going to hate me, and some people are going to like me.”
Next year’s Town Board will have three retired town police officers who, in addition to collecting salaries, will also be earning pensions. According to the Empire Center’s SeeThroughNY.com, Mr. Dunleavy earned a $34,285 pension this year and Mr. Wooten earned $45,556. Mr. Hubbard retired this year; his information is not on the website.
Mr. Walter agreed to let the resolution go to a vote Tuesday, and predicted it would be a story in Newsday.
The supervisor said the reason the Huntington supervisor’s salary, along with those of supervisors and mayors in Nassau County, is so high, is because they have these type of annual cost of living salary increases built into their budgets.
The issue is expected to come up for a vote at Tuesday’s board meeting, which starts at 7 p.m. in Town Hall.",Who proposed a draft resolution for an annual cost of living increase for all elected officials in Riverhead town?,Riverhead Councilman John Dunleavy proposed a draft resolution for an annual cost of living increase for all elected officials in the town.

"Got to Dance judge Adam Garcia, has returned to London’s West End stage in Tap Dogs – the internationally acclaimed dance show created by Olivier Award winning choreographer Dein Perry. The Aussie actor took time out from tap dancing to share his holiday experiences with CD Traveller
What do you like to do on holiday?
I either like to visit old cities or places of outstanding natural beauty. I’m not into spending all day lying on a sun lounger: I like to get out and about and explore.
Where did you last go?
Marrakech – the pink city. As it happened, I had an ankle injury so I did flop in the sun by the pool – a lot.
Do you know where you’re going this year?
I don’t. This year is proving to be very busy and I haven’t had time to firm up any definite travel plans. I am going to try and visit a friend in Stockholm this summer but it will need to be well planned: I get 48 hours off between Tap Dogs‘ end of week Sunday show and the next one on Tuesday night so I’ll have to stick to a tight travel schedule.
Of all the places you’ve been to, what was your favourite and why?
Wow. Umm… I do like island holidays. When I was a boy, my family took a trip to Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef. Heron Island has a bird and turtle sanctuary and so the island did smell strongly of guano but one got used to that. When I went, Heron Island was relatively untouched by tourism and there was so much wildlife to observe that I was in heaven.
Which destination do you wish to travel but haven’t been?
Yellowstone National Park – I’m working on it!
In your own country, what would you recommend tourists see that isn’t in the travel guides?
I would probably say that finding one of the zillion empty beaches up & down the coasts or else driving out to the farmlands is pretty great.
How do you plan your holiday?
I really just pick a destination, maybe a hotel & then make it up once I get there.
How often do you go away?
Typically two or three times a year.
Who do you travel with?
My Mother. We have travelled to some amazing places together –The Galapagos Islands, cloud forests in Ecuador & the Amazon Basin, Svalbard in the Arctic Circle – to look at the wildlife. It’s a shared passion. My Mother is an inspirational traveler and has been everywhere. Her next trip is Madagascar which I can’t join her on & am very envious. That island hasn’t long to last.
Where do you see tourism in your country in 10 years time?
I’m fairly confident Australia will be a firm favourite with tourists in 10 years – particularly if plane travel gets quicker. Its check list of essential experiences remains as strong as ever and shows no sign of diminishing.
Thanks Adam!

"NBA Trade Rumors: Latest Buzz on Carmelo Anthony, Brandon Knight and MoreJuly 17, 2017
The 2017 edition of the NBA offseason has been an entertaining one. While it's often the NFL that commands the summer offseason, basketball has remained front and center ever since the end of the NBA Finals.
The offseason began with a stellar draft class and some headline-grabbing trades and has continued to shine throughout an entertaining summer league. Even as we enter the second half of July, media attention remains high thanks to the possibility of some more notable moves.
Many of the biggest tradable players of the offseason—like Chris Paul, Paul George and Jimmy Butler—have already been moved. However, there are still some notable guys who could be traded. We're here to examine the latest trade buzz as the offseason continues.
Carmelo Trade Still a Possibility
Carmelo Anthony remains the most notable name on the trade market. He was the subject of trade rumors before Phil Jackson was ousted as team president, and he remains at the center of them even now. The reason for this is that Anthony is an aging veteran, and the New York Knicks are looking toward yet another rebuild.
The fact Anthony is set to earn $54 million over the next two seasons doesn't exactly help his value with the retooling Knicks either.
However, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week that the Knicks were putting trade talks on hold. The team had been involved in talks with both the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers—the two teams Anthony is interested in joining via trade.
Anthony holds a no-trade clause in his current contract.
While Shelburne and Wojnarowski reported that the Knicks are interested in getting Anthony to return to the team, this doesn't mean a trade won't eventually happen. In fact, per Wojnarowski, Anthony is counting on the Knicks to resume talks him, league sources said.""
The one thing the Knicks may be able to rely on is the fact Anthony previously expressed his desire to remain in New York in order to be close to his son. It's not as if the team can sell him on championship aspirations. The team can, however, try selling him on a playing environment.
Trail Blazers, McCollum Getting in on the Carmelo Chase
The Cavaliers and the Rockets are the two teams Anthony has expressed interest in joining this offseason. However, that hasn't stopped other teams—or individual players—from trying to recruit Anthony.
The Portland Trail Blazers had previously been linked to Anthony as part of a three-team deal involving New York and Houston. However, Wojnarowski recently reported that Portland would instead prefer to land Anthony:
.""
Portland squeaked into the playoffs last season with a .500 record, so it might be presumptuous for the team to believe it can compete with the likes of the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference just be adding Anthony. However, it the Trail Blazers do feel they can be title contenders with Anthony, it would make zero sense to facilitate his trade to Houston.
Trail Blazers shooting guard C.J. McCollum got in on the recruiting action—and had a little bit of fun—over the weekend. He posted a Photoshopped picture of Anthony wearing a Portland uniform on his Instagram account, tagging Anthony in the photo.
While McCollum's post isn't likely to sway Anthony too much, it might be a reminder that some teams want him—after the Knicks spend a large part of the offseason acting like they don't.
Knicks Looking to Add a Point Guard
While the Knicks may ultimately trade away Anthony, they're also reportedly looking to acquire talent. According to Ian Begley of ESPN, New York is looking to add a point guard. Per Begley, Brandon Knight of the Phoenix Suns has come up in trade discussions, both as an addition and as part of a Carmelo deal:
.""
Knight averaged 11.0 points, 2.4 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game last season. He would presumably be a short-term option as New York develops rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina.
Marc Berman of the New York Post reported last week that the Knicks had inquired about both Bledsoe and free agent Ramon Sessions.
Sessions would likely be a last-ditch value option for the Knicks, assuming the team is looking for a starting point guard. The 31-year-old averaged just 16.2 minutes and 6.2 points per game last season. Knight and Bledsoe—who averaged 21.1 points and 6.3 assists last season—would appear to be better primary options.",Who are the two teams Carmelo Anthony is interested in joining via trade?,The Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

"You may remember that a couple of weeks ago I posted a photo of my cat that I mentioned was the result of a class I've been taking on dramatic natural lighting. Well, this week's assignment had to do with shooting portraits in the mid-day sun... a rather frightening prospect for anyone who's ever seen the horrendous raccoon eyes that can result from this setup. My go-to spot for outdoor portraits is open, dapple-free shade, where the light is even and eyes are un-squinted, but this class is all about pushing the envelope. For these portraits, we were to use reflectors to fill the shadows and make for nice, even lighting. This sweet girl was my model, and though she's little, she's fast... with a heavy camera and a huge piece of foam core (the cheapest reflector out there!), I hardly kept up at all. This week's favorite is the one where I finally got her standing still for a split-second (though you can tell she's plotting her next move!)...
And here's the one where she got away with my reflector... I'm telling you - she's FAST! (Thanks for stopping by, and have a great weekend!)

"Agent P
Agent P is a Figure for use in the Toy Box.
Abilities
- Hat Toss
Bio
Perry the Platypus, codenamed Agent P, is Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus. Unknown to his owners, he lives a double life as a secret agent for the O.W.C.A. (The Organization Without a Cool Acronym) a.k.a. ""The Agency"". The Agency is a government organization of animal spies. In the Agency, his immediate superior is Major Monogram. He is assigned to thwart the plans of the self-proclaimed ""evil"" Dr. Heinz Doofenschmirtz. They are best described as frenemies-sometimes helping each other, other times they're bitter enemies.
Perry was adopted at an animal shelter run by the O.W.C.A. by the Flynn-Fletcher Family. According to Phineas, Perry was chosen because he looked at both Phineas and Ferb at the same time. When they adopted the platypus, he was given the name ""Bartholomew"" before he was renamed ""Perry"".
Perry is normally found acting like a mindless platypus in front of his owners, Phineas and Ferb. He is also serious while not undercover, even in front of Major Monogram. Perry also deeply cares about the Flynn-Fletcher family and is afraid to lose them and would take immediate action whenever they are threatened.

One of the error was a mount point missing on one worker, it might be the biggest error occurrence's reason (need to check).

Next step would be to simply extract the listing and reschedule those.
The other errors are most probably issues in the current mercurial loader and should be dealt with in new tasks.

"The emotions of the pledge
The opinion-page column ``Ode to the flag,'' Oct. 6, asks, ``What about our tradition of separation of church and state?'' in regard to the addition of the words ``under God'' to the pledge. Separation of church and state does not mean that the United States must make no reference to God in the pledge. Separation means that no one religious denomination or church will be allowed to rule the American people. No church will be placed in a position of absolute or partial power which could force citizens to support it.
The right and freedom of each person to be governed by God is the mark of a true democracy. Jane McCaw Gronko, Fairhope, Ala.
This opinion-page columnist states that to salute the flag stirs strong personal emotions and that he is proud that his daughter recites the pledge of allegiance each morning. The salute stirs strong feelings in me as well, but of a different nature. It reminds me of totalitarian governments that require a daily recitation of obedience; of national dictators insecure in the loyalty of their citizens; of fanatic religious leaders chanting mindless litanies with their followers.
I have strong ties to my homeland - family, friends, memories - yet I am ultimately a citizen of the world. My loyalty must be global, as I feel part of the world family. An oath of allegiance to one ideology, nation, or flag is too narrow. We, the people of the earth, must understand our interdependence.
When my seven-year-old son stands to salute the flag each day in school, my heart says no. I want him to be proud of a national heritage that encourages freedom and civil rights. But he must also know that we have brothers and sisters around the globe. Margaret Baker Davis, LaVerne, Calif.
Militia is the people Regarding the letters column ``Bearing arms: Is it a right?,'' Oct. 6: I must correct the letter writer's mistaken view on the Second Amendment. This amendment clearly states that ``A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' This right is reserved for ``the people,'' not for the military.
Please also note that the word ``militia'' does not mean military, it refers to all of the people, separate from any organized army. The term ``well-regulated'' means well supplied. These meanings are in accordance with common usage at the time of the writing of the Bill of Rights and are clear in the other writings of James Madison (the author of the Second Amendment). David Robinson, Hazelton, Pa.","What does the term ""militia"" refer to according to the context?","The term ""militia"" refers to all of the people, separate from any organized army."
"Home Interior Design Ideas , Claesson Koivisto Rune‘s Haven couch features a really interesting technique. Its semi-transparent design provides this sofa a distinctive feel meanwhile enhancing the whole aspect of its style micro climate. That sofa’s ethereal look is really interesting for enhancing your interior design and we think its general lightness is a development and also the most powerful feature of this piece. The developers say that the sense of the materials lets air flow readily, which explains why this product is ideal for the outdoors. However, it may as well be used in the interior design of your home for instance is used facing a window. Four comfortable cushions accompany the fashionable sofa to be able to create a much more inviting seating area. A certain asymmetry had been one of the goals that the designers attempted to achieve to make the design less formalized and motivate users to decrease conventions, take their shoes off and rest comfortably while taking advantage of the breeze ….

"As we age, the wear and tear of everyday life results in damage to our DNA. Research shows that we are able to slow down and reduce this damage by increasing specific nutrients.
The challenge
We are all getting old
We are all aware of the wear and tear daily life has on our body, what we might not be so aware of is that some wear and tear also impacts our body's DNA, which is the blueprint of our life. As we age, the quality of our DNA declines, increasing the risk of some diseases.
DNA damage is the most fundamental cause of developmental and degenerative disease and accelerated ageing.
Our response
You are what you eat
What we eat, how much we exercise, lifestyle habits and our environment all have an influence on how much DNA damage occurs. Pioneering CSIRO research has demonstrated that damage to the bodies DNA is a fundamental disease that can be diagnosed and partially reversed.
A team of CSIRO scientists identified nine micronutrients that are significantly associated with DNA damage. The group also showed that supplementation with certain micronutrients can reduce DNA damage.
Through work lead by Dr Michael Fenech, CSIRO has developed a technique for measuring DNA damage which has placed us at the forefront of research and development of diagnostics.
The results
Damage control
Based on this research, Dr Fenech proposed a novel diseases prevention strategy based on the diagnosis and nutritional treatment of genome damage. This led to the development of Reach100 , a medical clinic offering diagnostic blood tests that measure DNA damage and information relating to the nutritional, life-style and environmental factors that influence it.
The team at Reach100 checks the levels of important micronutrients in the patient's blood, including red cell folate, serum folate and Vitamin B12, which are all essential for the body’s ability to replicate healthy DNA. Reach100 doctors then make recommendations about the health of the patients DNA, based on the results of these tests.
