"Bingley has some bracelets. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets. Then Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. Now, Bingley has 6 bracelets remaining. How many bracelets did Bingley have initially?","Let's denote the number of bracelets Bingley initially had as \( B \).

Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \) bracelets.

After receiving the bracelets from Kelly, Bingley has \( B + 4 \) bracelets.

Bingley then gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister, so he gives away \( \frac{1}{3} \times (B + 4) \) bracelets.

After giving the bracelets to his sister, Bingley has \( B + 4 - \frac{1}{3} \times (B + 4) \) bracelets remaining.

We are told that Bingley has 6 bracelets remaining, so we can set up the equation:

\[ B + 4 - \frac{1}{3} \times (B + 4) = 6 \]

To solve for \( B \), we first distribute the \( \frac{1}{3} \) to both terms in the parentheses:

\[ B + 4 - \frac{1}{3}B - \frac{4}{3} = 6 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ \frac{2}{3}B + \frac{8}{3} = 6 \]

To clear the fractions, multiply every term by 3:

\[ 2B + 8 = 18 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2B = 10 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ B = 5 \]

So, Bingley initially had 5 bracelets."
John is laying the foundation for 3 homes. Each home needs a slab of concrete that is 100 feet by 100 feet by .5 feet. Concrete has a density of 150 pounds per cubic foot. A pound of concrete cost $.02 per pound. How much does the foundation cost?,"First, we need to calculate the volume of concrete needed for one home's foundation. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular slab is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one home, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 100 \text{ feet} \times 100 \text{ feet} \times 0.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ V = 10,000 \text{ square feet} \times 0.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ V = 5,000 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since John is laying the foundation for 3 homes, the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) needed is:

\[ V_{\text{total}} = 5,000 \text{ cubic feet/home} \times 3 \text{ homes} \]
\[ V_{\text{total}} = 15,000 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the weight of the concrete required using the density of concrete. The weight \( W \) is given by the formula:

\[ W = V_{\text{total}} \times \text{density} \]

\[ W = 15,000 \text{ cubic feet} \times 150 \text{ pounds/cubic foot} \]
\[ W = 2,250,000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can calculate the cost of the concrete needed for the foundations. The cost \( C \) is given by the formula:

\[ C = W \times \text{cost per pound} \]

\[ C = 2,250,000 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.02/\text{pound} \]
\[ C = \$45,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the foundation for the 3 homes is \$45,000."
"Find the value of n if n ^ (n / (2+x)) = y, where x = 3 and y = 27.","Given the equation:

n ^ (n / (2+x)) = y

We are told that x = 3 and y = 27. Let's substitute these values into the equation:

n ^ (n / (2+3)) = 27

Now the equation becomes:

n ^ (n / 5) = 27

We know that 27 is 3^3, so we can rewrite 27 as 3^3:

n ^ (n / 5) = 3^3

Now we have an equation where the bases are equal (n and 3), so we can set the exponents equal to each other:

n / 5 = 3

Now we can solve for n:

n = 3 * 5
n = 15

Therefore, the value of n is 15."
"Quentavious has 5 nickels. His friend offers him some gum and will give him two pieces per nickel. If Quentavious leaves with 2 nickels, how many pieces of gum did he get?","Quentavious starts with 5 nickels. If he leaves with 2 nickels, he must have traded 5 - 2 = 3 nickels for gum.

His friend offers two pieces of gum per nickel. So for 3 nickels, Quentavious would get 3 nickels * 2 pieces of gum/nickel = 6 pieces of gum."
"Alok ordered 16 chapatis, 5 plates of rice, 7 plates of mixed vegetable, and 6 ice-cream cups. The cost of each chapati is Rs. 6, that of each plate of rice is Rs. 45, and that of mixed vegetable is Rs. 70. How much did Alok pay the cashier?","To calculate the total amount Alok paid, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective cost and then add all the amounts together.

Cost of chapatis = 16 chapatis * Rs. 6/chapati = Rs. 96
Cost of rice plates = 5 plates * Rs. 45/plate = Rs. 225
Cost of mixed vegetable plates = 7 plates * Rs. 70/plate = Rs. 490

Now, we add all the costs together to find the total amount Alok paid:

Total amount = Cost of chapatis + Cost of rice plates + Cost of mixed vegetable plates
Total amount = Rs. 96 + Rs. 225 + Rs. 490
Total amount = Rs. 811

Alok paid Rs. 811 to the cashier."
"There are 7 more sections that are undeveloped. Each of the remaining sections has a land area of 9473 square feet. A contractor is planning to build houses on the undeveloped land. If the contractor decides to leave 15% of each section as open space, what is the total area of the undeveloped land that can be used for building the houses?","First, we need to calculate the area that will be left as open space for each section. Since 15% of each section will be left as open space, we can calculate this by taking 15% of 9473 square feet.

Open space per section = 15% of 9473 square feet
Open space per section = 0.15 * 9473 square feet
Open space per section = 1420.95 square feet

Now, we need to calculate the area that can be used for building houses for each section by subtracting the open space from the total area of each section.

Area for building per section = Total area of each section - Open space per section
Area for building per section = 9473 square feet - 1420.95 square feet
Area for building per section = 8052.05 square feet

Since there are 7 undeveloped sections, we need to multiply the area for building per section by 7 to get the total area that can be used for building the houses.

Total area for building = Area for building per section * Number of sections
Total area for building = 8052.05 square feet * 7
Total area for building = 56364.35 square feet

Therefore, the total area of the undeveloped land that can be used for building the houses is 56364.35 square feet."
Two trains of length 100 m and 220 m are running towards each other on parallel lines at 42 kmph and another speed respectively. They will be clear of each other in 15.99872010239181 seconds from the moment they meet. What is the speed of the second train in kmph?,"To find the speed of the second train, we first need to determine the relative speed at which the two trains are moving towards each other. Since they are moving towards each other, their relative speeds will add up.

When the two trains meet, they will take 15.99872010239181 seconds to completely pass each other. The total distance they will cover in this time is the sum of their lengths, which is 100 m + 220 m = 320 m.

We can convert this distance to kilometers by dividing by 1000 (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer):
320 m = 320 / 1000 km = 0.32 km

Now, we can use the time they take to pass each other to find their relative speed in km/h. The formula to convert speed from km/s to km/h is:
Speed (km/h) = Distance (km) / Time (h)

First, we convert the time from seconds to hours:
15.99872010239181 seconds = 15.99872010239181 / 3600 hours ≈ 0.00444464447344217 hours

Now we can calculate the relative speed:
Relative speed (km/h) = 0.32 km / 0.00444464447344217 h ≈ 72 km/h

We know the speed of the first train is 42 kmph, so to find the speed of the second train, we subtract the speed of the first train from the relative speed:
Speed of second train = Relative speed - Speed of first train
Speed of second train = 72 km/h - 42 km/h = 30 km/h

Therefore, the speed of the second train is 30 kmph."
a train is moving at 4 / 5 of its usual speed . the train is 30 minutes too late . what is the usual time ( in hours ) for the train to complete the journey ?,"Let's denote the usual speed of the train as \( S \) and the usual time it takes to complete the journey as \( T \). 

When the train is moving at \( \frac{4}{5} \) of its usual speed, its speed becomes \( \frac{4}{5}S \).

Since speed and time are inversely proportional (when one increases, the other decreases), the time it takes for the train to complete the journey at this reduced speed will be \( \frac{5}{4} \) times the usual time. 

So, the time taken at reduced speed is \( \frac{5}{4}T \).

The train is 30 minutes (or \( \frac{1}{2} \) hour) too late, which means the time taken at reduced speed is \( T + \frac{1}{2} \) hours.

Setting up the equation, we have:

\[ \frac{5}{4}T = T + \frac{1}{2} \]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 5T = 4T + 2 \]

Subtract \( 4T \) from both sides:

\[ T = 2 \]

So, the usual time for the train to complete the journey is 2 hours."
"While playing at the arcade, Luke won 27 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 56 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 7 tickets a piece, how many could he buy?","Luke won a total of 27 tickets from 'whack a mole' and 56 tickets from 'skee ball'. To find out the total number of tickets he has, we add these two amounts together:

27 tickets + 56 tickets = 83 tickets

Now, if each piece of candy costs 7 tickets, we need to divide the total number of tickets Luke has by the cost per piece of candy to find out how many pieces he can buy:

83 tickets ÷ 7 tickets per candy = 11.8571

Since Luke can't buy a fraction of a piece of candy, we round down to the nearest whole number. Luke can buy 11 pieces of candy with his 83 tickets."
"Laura wants to bake a cake for her mother. She checks the recipe and the pantry and sees that she needs to buy 2 cups of flour, 2 cups of sugar, a cup of butter, and two eggs. The flour costs $4. The sugar costs $2. The eggs cost $.5, and the butter costs $2.5. When she is done baking it, she cuts the cake into 6 slices. Her mother enjoys a piece the first two days. But on the third day, they discover that Kevin, her dog, ate the rest of the cake. How much did the amount the dog ate cost?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients Laura used to bake the cake:

- Flour: $4
- Sugar: $2
- Butter: $2.5
- Eggs: $0.5 (since it's $.5 for two eggs)

Total cost = $4 + $2 + $2.5 + $0.5 = $9

Laura cut the cake into 6 slices, and her mother ate 2 slices over the first two days. That means there were 4 slices left when Kevin, the dog, ate the rest of the cake.

The cost of the 4 slices eaten by the dog would be:

(4 slices / 6 slices) * $9 = $6

So, the amount the dog ate cost $6."
"The edges of a cube increased by a certain percentage, resulting in a 33.1% increase in surface area. What is the percentage increase in the length of each edge?","Let's denote the original length of an edge of the cube as \( L \), and the new length of an edge after the increase as \( L' \).

The surface area of the original cube is \( 6L^2 \), since a cube has 6 faces and the area of each face is \( L^2 \).

The surface area of the new cube is \( 6(L')^2 \).

According to the problem, the surface area of the cube increases by 33.1%, so we have:

\[ 6(L')^2 = 6L^2 + 0.331 \cdot 6L^2 \]
\[ 6(L')^2 = 6L^2(1 + 0.331) \]
\[ 6(L')^2 = 6L^2 \cdot 1.331 \]
\[ (L')^2 = L^2 \cdot 1.331 \]
\[ L' = L \cdot \sqrt{1.331} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in the length of each edge. The percentage increase is given by:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{L' - L}{L} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting \( L' = L \cdot \sqrt{1.331} \) into the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{L \cdot \sqrt{1.331} - L}{L} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \sqrt{1.331} - 1 \right) \times 100\% \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( \sqrt{1.331} \):

\[ \sqrt{1.331} \approx 1.153 \]

Substituting this value into the equation for the percentage increase, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = (1.153 - 1) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.153 \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 15.3\% \]

Therefore, the length of each edge of the cube increased by approximately 15.3%."
"A bookstore sold 85 calculators, generating $3,875 in sales. Two kinds of calculators were sold at different prices. They sold 35 of one kind at $67 each. What was the price of the other kind of calculator?","Let's denote the price of the other kind of calculator as \( P \).

The bookstore sold 35 calculators of the first kind at $67 each, so the total sales from this kind of calculator is:
\( 35 \times $67 = $2,345 \)

The total sales from both kinds of calculators is $3,875. So the sales from the second kind of calculator is:
\( $3,875 - $2,345 = $1,530 \)

The bookstore sold 85 calculators in total, and we know that 35 of them were of the first kind, so the number of the second kind of calculator sold is:
\( 85 - 35 = 50 \)

Now we can find the price of the other kind of calculator by dividing the total sales of the second kind by the number of calculators of that kind sold:
\( P = \frac{$1,530}{50} \)

\( P = $30.60 \)

So the price of the other kind of calculator was $30.60."
Tina has some pink pens. She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. Tina has 21 pens in total. How many pink pens does Tina have?,"Let's denote the number of pink pens Tina has as P.

According to the information given, Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. So, the number of green pens is P - 9.

Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens, so the number of blue pens is (P - 9) + 3, which simplifies to P - 6.

The total number of pens Tina has is the sum of the pink, green, and blue pens, which is 21. So we can write the equation:

P + (P - 9) + (P - 6) = 21

Combining like terms, we get:

3P - 15 = 21

Adding 15 to both sides of the equation, we get:

3P = 21 + 15
3P = 36

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

P = 36 / 3
P = 12

Therefore, Tina has 12 pink pens."
"If the difference between compound interest (interest compounded yearly) and simple interest on a sum for 2 years at 10% p.a. is a certain amount, and the sum is Rs. 15,000, what is the difference between the compound interest and simple interest?","Let's calculate the simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) on the sum of Rs. 15,000 for 2 years at 10% per annum.

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:
SI = P * R * T / 100
where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time period in years.

For the given problem:
P = Rs. 15,000
R = 10%
T = 2 years

SI = 15000 * 10 * 2 / 100
SI = 15000 * 20 / 100
SI = 15000 * 0.2
SI = Rs. 3000

Compound Interest (CI) is calculated using the formula:
CI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P
where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time period in years.

For the given problem:
P = Rs. 15,000
R = 10%
T = 2 years

CI = 15000 * (1 + 10/100)^2 - 15000
CI = 15000 * (1 + 0.1)^2 - 15000
CI = 15000 * (1.1)^2 - 15000
CI = 15000 * 1.21 - 15000
CI = 18150 - 15000
CI = Rs. 3150

Now, let's find the difference between the compound interest and simple interest:

Difference = CI - SI
Difference = 3150 - 3000
Difference = Rs. 150

Therefore, the difference between the compound interest and simple interest on a sum of Rs. 15,000 for 2 years at 10% per annum is Rs. 150."
"Two trains of length 90 m and 100 m are a certain distance apart. They start moving towards each other on parallel tracks, at speeds 71 kmph and 89 kmph. The trains meet after 4.499640028797696 seconds. What is the initial distance between the trains?","To find the initial distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train covers before they meet and then add those distances together.

First, we convert the speeds from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) because the time given is in seconds.

Speed of the first train in m/s = 71 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds)
Speed of the first train in m/s = 71 * 1000 / 3600
Speed of the first train in m/s = 71 / 3.6
Speed of the first train in m/s ≈ 19.7222 m/s

Speed of the second train in m/s = 89 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds)
Speed of the second train in m/s = 89 * 1000 / 3600
Speed of the second train in m/s = 89 / 3.6
Speed of the second train in m/s ≈ 24.7222 m/s

Now, we calculate the distance each train covers before they meet.

Distance covered by the first train = Speed of the first train * Time
Distance covered by the first train ≈ 19.7222 m/s * 4.499640028797696 seconds
Distance covered by the first train ≈ 88.725 m (rounded to three decimal places)

Distance covered by the second train = Speed of the second train * Time
Distance covered by the second train ≈ 24.7222 m/s * 4.499640028797696 seconds
Distance covered by the second train ≈ 111.275 m (rounded to three decimal places)

The initial distance between the trains is the sum of the distances covered by both trains.

Initial distance = Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train
Initial distance ≈ 88.725 m + 111.275 m
Initial distance ≈ 200 m

Therefore, the initial distance between the two trains was approximately 200 meters."
"the slant height of a cone is 18 cm and radius of the base is 8 cm , find the curved surface of the cone ?","The curved surface area (CSA) of a cone can be calculated using the formula:

CSA = π * r * l

where r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height of the cone.

Given:
r = 8 cm
l = 18 cm

Let's plug these values into the formula:

CSA = π * 8 cm * 18 cm
CSA = 144π cm²

Now, we can either leave the answer in terms of π or calculate the numerical value using the approximation π ≈ 3.14159.

CSA ≈ 144 * 3.14159 cm²
CSA ≈ 452.389 cm²

So, the curved surface area of the cone is approximately 452.389 square centimeters."
"During a certain season, a team won 65 percent of its first 100 games and 50 percent of its remaining games. If the team won 70 percent of its games for the entire season, what was the total number of games that the team played?","Let's denote the total number of games played by the team as \( G \), and the number of remaining games (after the first 100) as \( R \). 

From the information given, we know that the team won 65 games out of the first 100 games (since they won 65 percent of these games). 

For the remaining games, the team won 50 percent, so they won \( 0.5R \) games.

The total number of games won by the team over the entire season is 70 percent of the total number of games, which is \( 0.7G \).

We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 65 + 0.5R = 0.7G \]

We also know that the total number of games \( G \) is the sum of the first 100 games and the remaining games \( R \):

\[ G = 100 + R \]

Now we can substitute \( G \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ 65 + 0.5R = 0.7(100 + R) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 65 + 0.5R = 70 + 0.7R \]

Now, let's solve for \( R \):

\[ 0.7R - 0.5R = 70 - 65 \]

\[ 0.2R = 5 \]

\[ R = 5 / 0.2 \]

\[ R = 25 \]

Now that we have the number of remaining games, we can find the total number of games \( G \):

\[ G = 100 + R \]

\[ G = 100 + 25 \]

\[ G = 125 \]

So, the team played a total of 125 games during the season."
"Monroe made some granola bars for her family. She and her husband ate 80, and the rest was divided equally among her children. Each child received 20 granola bars, and there are 6 children in the family. How many granola bars did Monroe make?","If each of the 6 children received 20 granola bars, then the total number of granola bars the children received is:
6 children * 20 granola bars/child = 120 granola bars

Monroe and her husband ate 80 granola bars, so the total number of granola bars Monroe made is:
120 granola bars (for the children) + 80 granola bars (eaten by Monroe and her husband) = 200 granola bars

Therefore, Monroe made 200 granola bars."
"For a birthday party, Jerry bought some regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, he filled up 7 shelves. How many regular sodas did Jerry buy?","Jerry filled up 7 shelves with sodas, and each shelf holds 9 sodas. So, the total number of sodas that fit in the fridge is 7 shelves * 9 sodas per shelf = 63 sodas.

Out of these 63 sodas, 22 are diet sodas. To find out how many regular sodas Jerry bought, we subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas:

63 total sodas - 22 diet sodas = 41 regular sodas.

Jerry bought 41 regular sodas."
"For the natural numbers A, B, and C, when A is divided by 8, the quotient is B and the remainder is C. If the quotient and the remainder are equal, find the largest number of A.","Let's denote A as the natural number we are looking for, B as the quotient when A is divided by 8, and C as the remainder. According to the problem, B = C.

When a number A is divided by 8, the remainder C can be any number from 0 to 7 because the remainder is always less than the divisor. Since B and C are equal, B can also be any number from 0 to 7.

The largest possible value for B and C, when they are equal, is 7. Therefore, the largest possible remainder when A is divided by 8 is 7, and the quotient is also 7.

We can express A as follows:
A = 8B + C

Since B = C and both are equal to 7, we have:
A = 8(7) + 7
A = 56 + 7
A = 63

Therefore, the largest number A for which the quotient and the remainder are equal when A is divided by 8 is 63."
A train running at the speed of 180 km/hr crosses a pole in a certain amount of time. The length of the train is 450 meters. How many seconds does it take for the train to cross the pole?,"To find the time it takes for the train to cross the pole, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s), and then use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to m/s:

Speed in km/hr = 180 km/hr
Speed in m/s = (180 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr)

Speed in m/s = 180,000 m/hr / 3600 s/hr
Speed in m/s = 50 m/s

Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the pole using the length of the train as the distance:

Distance = Length of the train = 450 meters
Speed = 50 m/s

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 450 m / 50 m/s
Time = 9 seconds

Therefore, it takes 9 seconds for the train to cross the pole."
"The average (arithmetic mean) of 10, 20, and 60 is 5 more than the average of 10, 40, and what number?","First, let's find the average of 10, 20, and 60. To find the average, you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers.

Average of 10, 20, and 60:
(10 + 20 + 60) / 3 = 90 / 3 = 30

Now, let's find the average of 10, 40, and x (where x is the unknown number we are trying to find). We know that this average is 5 less than the average we just found, which is 30.

So, the average of 10, 40, and x is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now we can set up the equation for the average of 10, 40, and x:
(10 + 40 + x) / 3 = 25

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator:
10 + 40 + x = 25 * 3
10 + 40 + x = 75

Now, subtract 10 and 40 from both sides to solve for x:
x = 75 - 10 - 40
x = 25

So, the number we are looking for is 25."
Sandy bought a football for $9.14 and a baseball. She paid for both items with a $20 bill and received $4.05 change. How much did the baseball cost?,"To find out how much the baseball cost, we need to calculate the total amount Sandy spent on both items and then subtract the cost of the football.

First, let's find out the total amount spent:
Sandy received $4.05 in change after paying with a $20 bill, so the total amount spent on both items is:
$20.00 - $4.05 = $15.95

Now, we know the cost of the football:
$9.14

To find the cost of the baseball, we subtract the cost of the football from the total amount spent:
$15.95 - $9.14 = $6.81

Therefore, the baseball cost $6.81."
"Moore's family compared mobile phone plans to get the best deal. At T-Mobile, the family plan costs $50 per month for the first two lines and $16 for each additional line. T-Mobile offers a 10% discount on the total bill for enrolling in autopay, but charges an extra $3 per line for unlimited data. Additionally, T-Mobile requires a 2-year contract to lock in this pricing, and provides a $100 account credit at the end of the contract term. 

At M-Mobile, the family plan costs $45 for the first two lines and $14 for each additional line with a 1-year commitment. M-Mobile provides free unlimited data, but charges a one-time $20 activation fee for each line. As a special promotion, M-Mobile is offering a free high-speed hotspot feature (valued at $5/month per line) for customers who enroll in a 1-year commitment.

Moore's family needs to purchase 5 cell phone lines and wants to compare the costs after one year, considering the discounts, additional fees, activation charges, long-term commitment requirements, and benefits for each company. How much cheaper is the M-Mobile plan than the T-Mobile plan at the end of the first year?","Let's calculate the cost for each plan for Moore's family, which requires 5 lines.

**T-Mobile:**
- Cost for the first two lines: $50 per month
- Cost for the additional three lines: $16 per line per month
- Autopay discount: 10% on the total bill
- Unlimited data charge: $3 per line per month
- 2-year contract with a $100 account credit at the end of the term

First, let's calculate the monthly cost before the autopay discount and the unlimited data charge:
Monthly cost for 5 lines = $50 + ($16 * 3) = $50 + $48 = $98

Now, let's add the unlimited data charge for 5 lines:
Unlimited data charge = $3 * 5 = $15

So, the total monthly cost before the autopay discount is:
Total monthly cost = $98 + $15 = $113

Now, let's apply the 10% autopay discount:
Autopay discount = 10% of $113 = $11.30

The monthly cost after the autopay discount is:
Monthly cost after discount = $113 - $11.30 = $101.70

The cost for one year (12 months) would be:
Annual cost = $101.70 * 12 = $1220.40

Since the $100 account credit is given at the end of the 2-year term, we won't consider it for the first year's cost.

**M-Mobile:**
- Cost for the first two lines: $45 per month
- Cost for the additional three lines: $14 per line per month
- Free unlimited data
- 1-year commitment
- One-time activation fee: $20 per line
- Free high-speed hotspot feature

Monthly cost for 5 lines = $45 + ($14 * 3) = $45 + $42 = $87

The cost for one year (12 months) would be:
Annual cost = $87 * 12 = $1044

Now, let's add the one-time activation fee for 5 lines:
Activation fee = $20 * 5 = $100

So, the total cost for the first year with M-Mobile is:
Total first-year cost = $1044 + $100 = $1144

Now, let's compare the costs:
Difference in cost = T-Mobile's annual cost - M-Mobile's annual cost
Difference in cost = $1220.40 - $1144 = $76.40

Therefore, the M-Mobile plan is $76.40 cheaper than the T-Mobile plan at the end of the first year."
"The treehouse is almost done; all they need is to paint it. His father estimated that they will use 20 ounces of white paint, 15 ounces of green paint and some ounces of brown paint. They would buy in total 69 ounces of paint. How many ounces of brown paint would they buy?","To find out how many ounces of brown paint they would buy, we need to subtract the total amount of white and green paint from the total amount of paint they plan to buy.

White paint: 20 ounces
Green paint: 15 ounces
Total paint to buy: 69 ounces

Brown paint = Total paint - (White paint + Green paint)
Brown paint = 69 ounces - (20 ounces + 15 ounces)
Brown paint = 69 ounces - 35 ounces
Brown paint = 34 ounces

They would buy 34 ounces of brown paint."
"A shipment of 250 smartphones contains 76 that are defective. If a customer buys two smartphones at random from the shipment, what is the approximate probability that both phones are defective?","To find the probability that both smartphones are defective, we can use the formula for the probability of independent events, which is the product of the probabilities of each event occurring. However, in this case, the events are not independent because the outcome of the first draw affects the probability of the second draw. Therefore, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

The probability that the first smartphone is defective is the number of defective smartphones divided by the total number of smartphones:

P(First is defective) = Number of defective smartphones / Total number of smartphones
P(First is defective) = 76 / 250

After one defective smartphone is taken, there are 75 defective smartphones left and the total number of smartphones is reduced to 249.

The probability that the second smartphone is defective given that the first one was defective is:

P(Second is defective | First is defective) = Number of remaining defective smartphones / Total remaining smartphones
P(Second is defective | First is defective) = 75 / 249

Now, we multiply the two probabilities to find the probability that both smartphones are defective:

P(Both are defective) = P(First is defective) * P(Second is defective | First is defective)
P(Both are defective) = (76 / 250) * (75 / 249)

Let's calculate this:

P(Both are defective) = (76 / 250) * (75 / 249)
P(Both are defective) ≈ (0.304) * (0.3012)
P(Both are defective) ≈ 0.09154

So, the approximate probability that both smartphones are defective is 0.09154, or about 9.154%."

"A car dealership has 40 cars on the lot, 20% of which are silver. The dealership receives a new shipment of some cars, 35% of which are not silver. The percentage of total number of cars that are silver is 30%. How many cars were in the new shipment?","Let's start by calculating the number of silver cars in the original lot. Since 20% of the 40 cars are silver, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 40 = 0.20 * 40 = 8 silver cars

Now, let's denote the number of cars in the new shipment as x. According to the information given, 35% of these cars are not silver, which means that 65% of them are silver. So, the number of silver cars in the new shipment is:

65% of x = 0.65 * x

After the new shipment, the total number of cars is 40 + x, and the total number of silver cars is 8 (from the original lot) plus 0.65x (from the new shipment). We are told that the percentage of total number of cars that are silver is now 30%. We can set up the following equation:

(8 + 0.65x) / (40 + x) = 0.30

Now, let's solve for x:

8 + 0.65x = 0.30 * (40 + x)
8 + 0.65x = 0.30 * 40 + 0.30x
8 + 0.65x = 12 + 0.30x
0.65x - 0.30x = 12 - 8
0.35x = 4
x = 4 / 0.35
x = 11.4285714286

Since the number of cars must be a whole number, we round x to the nearest whole number:

x ≈ 11

Therefore, the new shipment consisted of approximately 11 cars."
"If 8 men or 12 women can do a piece of work in 15 days, in how many days can the same work be done by 6 men and 11 women?","Let's first find the work rate of one man and one woman.

If 8 men can do the work in 15 days, then one man can do the work in 8 * 15 days. So, the work rate of one man is 1 / (8 * 15).

Similarly, if 12 women can do the work in 15 days, then one woman can do the work in 12 * 15 days. So, the work rate of one woman is 1 / (12 * 15).

Now, let's find the combined work rate of 6 men and 11 women.

The work rate of 6 men is 6 * (1 / (8 * 15)) = 6 / (8 * 15).
The work rate of 11 women is 11 * (1 / (12 * 15)) = 11 / (12 * 15).

The combined work rate of 6 men and 11 women is the sum of their individual work rates:

Combined work rate = (6 / (8 * 15)) + (11 / (12 * 15)).

To simplify, we can find a common denominator, which is (8 * 12 * 15):

Combined work rate = (6 * 12 / (8 * 12 * 15)) + (11 * 8 / (8 * 12 * 15))
                   = (72 / (8 * 12 * 15)) + (88 / (8 * 12 * 15))
                   = (72 + 88) / (8 * 12 * 15)
                   = 160 / (8 * 12 * 15).

Now, we can simplify the fraction:

Combined work rate = 160 / (8 * 12 * 15)
                   = 160 / (96 * 15)
                   = 160 / 1440
                   = 1 / 9.

This means that 6 men and 11 women can complete 1/9 of the work in one day.

To find out how many days it will take for them to complete the work, we take the reciprocal of the combined work rate:

Days to complete the work = 1 / (1 / 9)
                          = 9.

Therefore, 6 men and 11 women can complete the work in 9 days."
"On a shopping trip, Jill spent 50 percent of her total amount on clothing, 10 percent on food, and 40 percent on other items. She paid a 4 percent tax on the clothing, no tax on the food, and a certain percentage tax on all other items. The total tax that she paid was 5.2 percent of the total amount that she spent, excluding taxes. What percentage tax did Jill pay on the other items?","Let's assume Jill spent a total of $100 before taxes for simplicity.

She spent 50% on clothing, which is $50.
She spent 10% on food, which is $10.
She spent 40% on other items, which is $40.

Now, she paid a 4% tax on clothing, which is 4% of $50 = $2.
She paid no tax on food, so the tax is $0.
Let's assume she paid x% tax on other items, which would be x% of $40.

The total tax she paid is 5.2% of the total amount spent before taxes, which is 5.2% of $100 = $5.20.

Now we can set up the equation:

Tax on clothing + Tax on food + Tax on other items = Total tax
$2 + $0 + (x% of $40) = $5.20

We need to find x% of $40 that will make the equation true:

$2 + (x/100 * $40) = $5.20

Now we solve for x:

x/100 * $40 = $5.20 - $2
x/100 * $40 = $3.20

Now we divide both sides by $40 to isolate x/100:

x/100 = $3.20 / $40
x/100 = 0.08

Now we multiply both sides by 100 to find x:

x = 0.08 * 100
x = 8

Jill paid an 8% tax on the other items."
Kim drives 30 miles to her friend's house. On the way back she has to take a detour that is 20% longer. She spends 30 minutes at her friend's house. She drives at a certain speed. She spent 2 hours away from home. What was her driving speed?,"Let's denote Kim's driving speed as \( v \) miles per hour.

The distance from Kim's house to her friend's house is 30 miles. The detour on the way back is 20% longer than the direct route, so the detour distance is \( 30 \text{ miles} + 0.20 \times 30 \text{ miles} = 30 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

The total distance Kim drives is the sum of the distance to her friend's house and the detour distance on the way back, which is \( 30 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} = 66 \text{ miles} \).

Kim spends 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours) at her friend's house, so the total time she spends driving is \( 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \).

To find her driving speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Plugging in the values we have:

\[ v = \frac{66 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ v = 44 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Kim's driving speed was 44 miles per hour."
"Three pipes A, B, and C can fill tanks X, Y, and Z from empty to full in 20 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes, respectively. The capacities of tanks X, Y, and Z are 1800 liters, 2400 liters, and 3600 liters, respectively. When all the tanks are empty, pipes A, B, and C are opened, and they discharge chemical solutions P, Q, and R, respectively. Pipe A's flow rate increases by 10% every minute, while pipes B and C maintain a constant flow rate. What is the proportion of solution R in the combined liquid in the tanks after 3 minutes?","First, let's calculate the flow rates of pipes A, B, and C.

Pipe A fills tank X (1800 liters) in 20 minutes, so its initial flow rate is:
Flow rate of A = 1800 liters / 20 minutes = 90 liters/minute

Pipe B fills tank Y (2400 liters) in 20 minutes, so its flow rate is:
Flow rate of B = 2400 liters / 20 minutes = 120 liters/minute

Pipe C fills tank Z (3600 liters) in 30 minutes, so its flow rate is:
Flow rate of C = 3600 liters / 30 minutes = 120 liters/minute

Now, let's calculate the amount of liquid discharged by each pipe after 3 minutes, taking into account that pipe A's flow rate increases by 10% every minute.

For pipe A, the flow rate increases by 10% each minute, so:
- At minute 1, the flow rate is 90 liters/minute + 10% of 90 = 90 + 9 = 99 liters
- At minute 2, the flow rate is 99 liters/minute + 10% of 99 = 99 + 9.9 = 108.9 liters
- At minute 3, the flow rate is 108.9 liters/minute + 10% of 108.9 = 108.9 + 10.89 = 119.79 liters

Total discharge by pipe A after 3 minutes = 90 + 99 + 108.9 + 119.79 = 417.69 liters

For pipe B, the flow rate is constant, so:
Total discharge by pipe B after 3 minutes = 120 liters/minute * 3 minutes = 360 liters

For pipe C, the flow rate is also constant, so:
Total discharge by pipe C after 3 minutes = 120 liters/minute * 3 minutes = 360 liters

Now, let's calculate the total volume of the combined liquid after 3 minutes:
Total volume = discharge by A + discharge by B + discharge by C
Total volume = 417.69 liters + 360 liters + 360 liters
Total volume = 1137.69 liters

The proportion of solution R in the combined liquid is the amount discharged by pipe C divided by the total volume:
Proportion of R = discharge by C / Total volume
Proportion of R = 360 liters / 1137.69 liters

Now, let's calculate the proportion:
Proportion of R ≈ 360 / 1137.69 ≈ 0.3163

So, the proportion of solution R in the combined liquid after 3 minutes is approximately 31.63%."
"Elias uses a bar of soap every month, and there are three types of soap he uses with varying prices. The prices of the soap types are: 

1. Lavender Soap: $4/bar 
2. Lemon Soap: $5/bar
3. Sandalwood Soap: $6/bar

Elias alternates between soap types for each consecutive month (Lavender, Lemon, Sandalwood, Lavender, ...). 

In addition, whenever Elias buys soap, he gets different discounts for bulk purchases based on the quantity of each soap type. The discounts are as follows:

For Lavender Soap:
1. Buy 5 bars, get 10% off
2. Buy 10 bars, get 20% off

For Lemon Soap:
1. Buy 4 bars, get 5% off
2. Buy 8 bars, get 15% off

For Sandalwood Soap:
1. Buy 3 bars, get 5% off
2. Buy 6 bars, get 10% off
3. Buy 9 bars or more, get 20% off

Given this information, determine the total amount Elias spends on bars of soap in two years, taking into consideration the varying soap prices and bulk discounts based on the quantity of each soap type.","To calculate the total amount Elias spends on bars of soap in two years, we first need to determine how many bars of each type of soap he will use in two years and then apply the discounts for bulk purchases.

There are 12 months in a year, so in two years, there are 24 months. Since Elias alternates between the three types of soap each month, he will use each type of soap for 8 months in two years (24 months / 3 types of soap).

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type of soap for 8 bars without any discounts:

1. Lavender Soap: $4/bar * 8 bars = $32
2. Lemon Soap: $5/bar * 8 bars = $40
3. Sandalwood Soap: $6/bar * 8 bars = $48

Next, we apply the bulk discounts for each type of soap. Elias will buy the number of bars that maximizes his discount without exceeding the 8 bars he needs for two years.

For Lavender Soap, the best discount is to buy 5 bars to get 10% off, then buy the remaining 3 bars without a discount:
- 5 bars with 10% off: $4/bar * 5 bars = $20 - 10% = $20 - $2 = $18
- 3 bars without discount: $4/bar * 3 bars = $12
Total for Lavender Soap: $18 + $12 = $30

For Lemon Soap, the best discount is to buy 4 bars to get 5% off, then buy the remaining 4 bars with the same discount:
- 4 bars with 5% off: $5/bar * 4 bars = $20 - 5% = $20 - $1 = $19
- Another 4 bars with 5% off: $5/bar * 4 bars = $20 - 5% = $20 - $1 = $19
Total for Lemon Soap: $19 + $19 = $38

For Sandalwood Soap, the best discount is to buy 6 bars to get 10% off, then buy the remaining 2 bars without a discount:
- 6 bars with 10% off: $6/bar * 6 bars = $36 - 10% = $36 - $3.6 = $32.4
- 2 bars without discount: $6/bar * 2 bars = $12
Total for Sandalwood Soap: $32.4 + $12 = $44.4

Finally, we add up the total cost for all three types of soap:
Total amount spent in two years = Total for Lavender Soap + Total for Lemon Soap + Total for Sandalwood Soap
Total amount spent in two years = $30 + $38 + $44.4 = $112.4

Therefore, Elias spends $112.4 on bars of soap in two years."
A person borrowed an amount of $12500 for a year at an interest rate of 12%. What is the total interest for the year?,"To calculate the total interest for the year, you can use the simple interest formula:

Interest (I) = Principal (P) x Rate (R) x Time (T)

Where:
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed)
- R is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)
- T is the time the money is borrowed for, in years

Given:
P = $12500
R = 12% per year = 0.12 (as a decimal)
T = 1 year

Now, plug these values into the formula:

I = P x R x T
I = $12500 x 0.12 x 1
I = $1500

So, the total interest for the year is $1500."
A retailer bought a machine at a wholesale price of $90 and later on sold it after a 10% discount of the retail price. The retailer made a profit equivalent to a certain percentage of the wholesale price. The retail price of the machine is $120. What is the profit percentage on the wholesale price?,"First, let's calculate the selling price of the machine after the 10% discount on the retail price.

The retail price of the machine is $120, and the discount is 10% of that price.

Discount amount = 10% of $120
                 = (10/100) * $120
                 = $12

So, the selling price after the discount is:

Selling price = Retail price - Discount amount
               = $120 - $12
               = $108

Now, let's calculate the profit made by the retailer.

Profit = Selling price - Wholesale price
        = $108 - $90
        = $18

To find the profit percentage on the wholesale price, we use the formula:

Profit percentage = (Profit / Wholesale price) * 100%

Profit percentage = ($18 / $90) * 100%
                   = 0.2 * 100%
                   = 20%

Therefore, the retailer made a profit of 20% on the wholesale price."
"In one day, 200 people visit The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Half of the visitors are residents of New York City. Of the NYC residents, some percentage are college students. The museum gets $120 from college students that are residents of NYC. What percentage of NYC residents are college students?","Let's denote the number of NYC residents who are college students as \( x \).

Given that half of the 200 visitors are residents of New York City, there are \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) NYC residents.

The museum gets $120 from college students that are residents of NYC. Assuming that each college student pays the same amount for the entrance fee, let's denote the entrance fee for a college student as \( y \).

So, the total amount of money from college students is the number of college students times the entrance fee:
\[ x \cdot y = 120 \]

We need to find the percentage of NYC residents who are college students, which is \( \frac{x}{100} \times 100 \) percent.

However, we don't have the value of \( y \) (the entrance fee for a college student), which is necessary to calculate \( x \). Without this information, we cannot determine the percentage of NYC residents who are college students. 

If you can provide the entrance fee for a college student, we can then calculate the percentage."
"Harry owns 3 geckos, 2 iguanas, and 4 snakes. Geckos are fed 2 times a month, iguanas 3 times a month, and snakes once every 2 months. The cost to feed a gecko for each meal is $8, to feed an iguana is $12, and to feed a snake is $20. How much does Harry spend every year to feed all his pets?","First, let's calculate the annual cost of feeding each type of pet.

For geckos:
- Each gecko is fed 2 times a month, so in a year (12 months), each gecko is fed 2 * 12 = 24 times.
- The cost to feed one gecko for each meal is $8, so the annual cost to feed one gecko is 24 * $8 = $192.
- Harry has 3 geckos, so the total annual cost to feed all geckos is 3 * $192 = $576.

For iguanas:
- Each iguana is fed 3 times a month, so in a year, each iguana is fed 3 * 12 = 36 times.
- The cost to feed one iguana for each meal is $12, so the annual cost to feed one iguana is 36 * $12 = $432.
- Harry has 2 iguanas, so the total annual cost to feed all iguanas is 2 * $432 = $864.

For snakes:
- Each snake is fed once every 2 months, so in a year, each snake is fed 12 / 2 = 6 times.
- The cost to feed one snake for each meal is $20, so the annual cost to feed one snake is 6 * $20 = $120.
- Harry has 4 snakes, so the total annual cost to feed all snakes is 4 * $120 = $480.

Now, let's add up the annual costs for all the pets:
Total annual cost = Cost for geckos + Cost for iguanas + Cost for snakes
Total annual cost = $576 + $864 + $480
Total annual cost = $1920

Harry spends $1920 every year to feed all his pets."
a certain rectangular crate measures 12 feet by 16 feet by 18 feet . a cylindrical gas tank is to be made for shipment in the crate and will stand upright when the crate is placed on one of its six faces . what should the radius of the tank be if it is to be of the largest possible volume ?,"To maximize the volume of the cylindrical gas tank, it should fit snugly within the crate when the crate is placed on one of its six faces. The dimensions of the crate are 12 feet by 16 feet by 18 feet. When the crate is placed on one of its faces, the height of the cylinder will be determined by the shortest side of the crate, which is 12 feet, to ensure the cylinder can stand upright.

The radius of the cylinder should be as large as possible, but it must fit within the dimensions of the base of the crate when it is standing on one of its faces. The two possible base dimensions for the crate are 16 feet by 18 feet or 12 feet by 18 feet or 12 feet by 16 feet. To maximize the radius, we should choose the larger base, which is 16 feet by 18 feet.

The diameter of the cylinder must be less than or equal to the shorter side of the base of the crate to fit within the crate. In this case, the shorter side of the base is 16 feet. Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder must be less than or equal to 16 feet.

The radius (r) of the cylinder is half the diameter, so the largest possible radius for the cylinder is:

r = diameter / 2
r = 16 feet / 2
r = 8 feet

Thus, the radius of the cylindrical gas tank should be 8 feet to be of the largest possible volume that can fit within the crate when it stands upright."
"Find the smallest number of six digits exactly divisible by 25, 35, 45, 15, 11, and 13.","To find the smallest six-digit number that is exactly divisible by 25, 35, 45, 15, 11, and 13, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. However, since the LCM must be a six-digit number, we will start by finding the LCM of the given numbers and then find the smallest six-digit multiple of that LCM.

First, let's find the prime factorization of each number:

- 25 = 5^2
- 35 = 5 × 7
- 45 = 3^2 × 5
- 15 = 3 × 5
- 11 is a prime number
- 13 is a prime number

Now, we find the LCM by taking the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of each number:

- The highest power of 2 is not present in any of the numbers.
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 45).
- The highest power of 5 is 5^2 (from 25).
- The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 35).
- The highest power of 11 is 11 (since 11 is a prime number).
- The highest power of 13 is 13 (since 13 is a prime number).

So, the LCM = 3^2 × 5^2 × 7 × 11 × 13

Calculating the LCM:

LCM = 9 × 25 × 7 × 11 × 13
LCM = 9 × 25 × 77 × 13
LCM = 225 × 1001
LCM = 225,225

Now, we have the LCM, but we need to find the smallest six-digit number that is a multiple of this LCM. The smallest six-digit number is 100,000. We need to find the smallest multiple of 225,225 that is greater than or equal to 100,000.

To find this, we divide 100,000 by 225,225 and take the ceiling of the result to find the next whole number multiple:

100,000 ÷ 225,225 ≈ 0.444

Since we need the smallest six-digit number, we take the next whole number after 0.444, which is 1. Then we multiply the LCM by this whole number to find the smallest six-digit number that is a multiple of the LCM:

Smallest six-digit multiple = 1 × 225,225 = 225,225

However, 225,225 is not a six-digit number. We need to find the next multiple of 225,225 that is a six-digit number. Since 225,225 is already a six-digit number, it is the smallest six-digit number that is exactly divisible by 25, 35, 45, 15, 11, and 13."
In what ratio must tea at a certain price per kg be mixed with tea at Rs. 74 per kg so that the mixture is worth Rs. 69 per kg? The required ratio is 1. What is the price of the first tea per kg?,"Let's denote the price of the first tea per kg as Rs. x.

According to the given information, we need to find the ratio in which tea at Rs. x per kg must be mixed with tea at Rs. 74 per kg to get a mixture worth Rs. 69 per kg.

We can use the rule of alligation to find the required ratio. The rule of alligation is a simple formula used to calculate the ratio in which two ingredients at different prices must be mixed to produce a mixture at a given price.

The formula is as follows:

(Cost of cheaper ingredient) : (Cost of dearer ingredient) = (Mean price - Cost of cheaper ingredient) : (Cost of dearer ingredient - Mean price)

In this case, the cheaper ingredient is the tea at Rs. x per kg, and the dearer ingredient is the tea at Rs. 74 per kg. The mean price is Rs. 69 per kg.

So, the ratio is:

(x) : (74) = (69 - x) : (74 - 69)

Since the required ratio is 1, we have:

(69 - x) : (74 - 69) = 1 : 1

This means that the difference between the mean price and the cost of the cheaper ingredient is equal to the difference between the cost of the dearer ingredient and the mean price.

69 - x = 74 - 69

Solving for x:

69 - x = 5
x = 69 - 5
x = 64

Therefore, the price of the first tea per kg is Rs. 64."
"When A is divided by 5, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is B. A and B are both natural numbers. What is the largest possible value of B?","When a number A is divided by 5, the remainder B can be any number from 0 to 4 because once the remainder reaches 5, it would be divisible by 5 and would be added to the quotient.

Given that the quotient is 2 when A is divided by 5, we can write the division as:

A = 5 * Quotient + Remainder
A = 5 * 2 + B
A = 10 + B

Since B must be less than 5, the largest possible value for B is 4. Therefore, the largest possible value of B is 4."
the average of 11 numbers is 10.7 . if the average of first 6 is 10.5 and that of the last 6.00001 is 11.4 the sixth number is ?,"Let's denote the sum of the first 6 numbers as S1 and the sum of the last 6 numbers as S2. The sixth number is included in both S1 and S2, so we'll call it X.

The average of the first 6 numbers is 10.5, so the sum of the first 6 numbers (S1) is:
S1 = 6 * 10.5

The average of the last 6 numbers is 11.4, so the sum of the last 6 numbers (S2) is:
S2 = 6 * 11.4

The average of all 11 numbers is 10.7, so the sum of all 11 numbers is:
Total sum = 11 * 10.7

Now, the sum of all 11 numbers is also equal to the sum of the first 5 numbers, plus the sixth number (X), plus the sum of the last 5 numbers. Since the sixth number is counted twice (once in S1 and once in S2), we need to subtract it once to get the total sum of the 11 unique numbers.

Total sum = (S1 - X) + X + (S2 - X)

Now we can plug in the values we have:

11 * 10.7 = (6 * 10.5 - X) + X + (6 * 11.4 - X)

Let's solve for X:

117.7 = (63 - X) + X + (68.4 - X)

Combine like terms:

117.7 = 63 + 68.4 - X

Now, add X to both sides and subtract 117.7 from both sides to solve for X:

X = 63 + 68.4 - 117.7

X = 131.4 - 117.7

X = 13.7

So, the sixth number is 13.7."
June's mom promises to pay her 1 cent for every cloverleaf she picks from the lawn. June picks some clovers in total. 75% have 3 petals. 24% have two petals and 1% have four petals. June earns 554 cents. How many clovers did June pick in total?,"Let's denote the total number of clovers June picked as \( C \).

According to the problem, 75% of the clovers have 3 petals, 24% have 2 petals, and 1% have 4 petals. Since June earns 1 cent for every cloverleaf she picks, we can calculate the total earnings based on the number of petals:

- For the 3-petal clovers, she earns \( 0.75C \) cents.
- For the 2-petal clovers, she earns \( 0.24C \) cents.
- For the 4-petal clovers, she earns \( 0.01C \) cents.

The total earnings from all the clovers would be the sum of the earnings from each type of clover:

Total earnings \( = 0.75C + 0.24C + 0.01C \)

We know that the total earnings are 554 cents, so we can set up the equation:

\( 0.75C + 0.24C + 0.01C = 554 \)

Combining like terms, we get:

\( 1C = 554 \)

This means that the total number of clovers \( C \) that June picked is 554.

So, June picked 554 clovers in total."
"a man swims downstream 48 km and upstream 18 km taking 3 hours each time , what is the speed of the man in still water ?","Let's denote the speed of the man in still water as \( v_m \) (in km/h) and the speed of the stream as \( v_s \) (in km/h).

When the man swims downstream, the effective speed is the sum of his speed and the speed of the stream, so it is \( v_m + v_s \). When he swims upstream, the effective speed is his speed minus the speed of the stream, so it is \( v_m - v_s \).

We are given that the man swims 48 km downstream and 18 km upstream, each in 3 hours.

Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can set up the following equations:

For downstream:
\[ (v_m + v_s) \times 3 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ km} \]
\[ 3v_m + 3v_s = 48 \]
\[ v_m + v_s = 16 \]  (Equation 1)

For upstream:
\[ (v_m - v_s) \times 3 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ km} \]
\[ 3v_m - 3v_s = 18 \]
\[ v_m - v_s = 6 \]  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for \( v_m \) by adding the two equations:

\[ (v_m + v_s) + (v_m - v_s) = 16 + 6 \]
\[ 2v_m = 22 \]
\[ v_m = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ v_m = 11 \text{ km/h} \]

So the speed of the man in still water is 11 km/h."
Bryan has 27 books and some magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves. He has a total of 621 books. How many magazines does he have in each bookshelf?,"First, let's find out how many books Bryan has on each bookshelf. Since he has a total of 621 books and 23 bookshelves, we divide the total number of books by the number of bookshelves:

621 books ÷ 23 bookshelves = 27 books per bookshelf

Since Bryan has 27 books on each bookshelf and we know that he has 27 books and some magazines on each bookshelf, it means he has no magazines on each bookshelf. All the items on his bookshelves are books."
A room of 5 m 44 cm long and 3 m 74 cm broad is to be paved with square tiles. Find the least number of square tiles required to cover the floor.,"To find the least number of square tiles required to cover the floor, we need to find the largest square tile that can fit both the length and the breadth of the room without leaving any space. This is essentially finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the length and breadth of the room, but we need to convert the measurements to the same unit first.

The room is 5 m 44 cm long and 3 m 74 cm broad. Let's convert these measurements to centimeters:
- Length: 5 m 44 cm = (5 × 100) + 44 = 544 cm
- Breadth: 3 m 74 cm = (3 × 100) + 74 = 374 cm

Now, we find the GCD of 544 cm and 374 cm.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:

544 = 374 × 1 + 170
374 = 170 × 2 + 34
170 = 34 × 5 + 0

When we reach a remainder of 0, the divisor at that step is the GCD. In this case, the GCD is 34 cm.

This means the largest square tile that can be used to pave the room without cutting is 34 cm × 34 cm.

Now, we need to find out how many such tiles are required to cover the floor.

The area of the room is:
Area = Length × Breadth
Area = 544 cm × 374 cm
Area = 203,456 cm²

The area of one tile is:
Tile Area = Side × Side
Tile Area = 34 cm × 34 cm
Tile Area = 1,156 cm²

The number of tiles required is:
Number of Tiles = Area of Room / Area of One Tile
Number of Tiles = 203,456 cm² / 1,156 cm²
Number of Tiles = 176

Therefore, 176 square tiles of 34 cm × 34 cm are required to cover the floor of the room."
Joan went to 4 football games this year. She went to some games last year. Joan went to 13 football games in all. How many games did she go to last year?,"To find out how many games Joan went to last year, we need to subtract the number of games she went to this year from the total number of games she went to in all.

Total number of games = 13
Number of games this year = 4

Number of games last year = Total number of games - Number of games this year
Number of games last year = 13 - 4
Number of games last year = 9

Joan went to 9 football games last year."
"A tank with a volume of 30 cubic feet has one inlet pipe and 2 outlet pipes. The inlet pipe fills water into the tank at the rate of 3 cubic inches/min and the 2 outlet pipes empty it out at different rates. One of the outlet pipes empties the tank at a rate of 6 cubic inches/min, and if all 3 pipes are opened when the tank is full, it takes 3456 minutes to empty the tank. What is the rate at which the other outlet pipe empties the tank in cubic inches/min? (1 foot = 12 inches)","First, let's convert the volume of the tank from cubic feet to cubic inches to match the units of the flow rates of the pipes.

1 cubic foot = 12 inches * 12 inches * 12 inches = 1728 cubic inches

So, the volume of the tank in cubic inches is:

30 cubic feet * 1728 cubic inches/cubic foot = 51840 cubic inches

Now, let's consider the flow rates of the pipes. The inlet pipe fills the tank at a rate of 3 cubic inches/min, and one of the outlet pipes empties it at a rate of 6 cubic inches/min. Let's denote the rate at which the other outlet pipe empties the tank as x cubic inches/min.

When all three pipes are open, the net rate at which the tank is being emptied is the sum of the rates of the outlet pipes minus the rate of the inlet pipe:

Net emptying rate = (6 + x) cubic inches/min - 3 cubic inches/min
Net emptying rate = x + 3 cubic inches/min

We know that it takes 3456 minutes to empty the tank when all three pipes are open, so we can set up the following equation:

Volume of tank / Net emptying rate = Time to empty tank
51840 cubic inches / (x + 3) cubic inches/min = 3456 minutes

Now, we can solve for x:

51840 cubic inches = (x + 3) cubic inches/min * 3456 minutes
51840 cubic inches = 3456x + 10368 cubic inches

Subtract 10368 from both sides to isolate the term with x:

51840 cubic inches - 10368 cubic inches = 3456x
41472 cubic inches = 3456x

Now, divide both sides by 3456 to solve for x:

x = 41472 cubic inches / 3456 minutes
x = 12 cubic inches/min

So, the rate at which the other outlet pipe empties the tank is 12 cubic inches/min."
"The number of trees is three times more than the number of stones in the courtyard. There are also twice as many birds in the trees as the combined number of trees and stones in the yard. If the number of stones is 40, how many birds are in the trees?","If the number of stones is 40, then the number of trees is three times more than that, which means:

Number of trees = 40 (number of stones) + 3 * 40 (three times more)
Number of trees = 40 + 120
Number of trees = 160

The combined number of trees and stones is:
160 (trees) + 40 (stones) = 200

Since there are twice as many birds in the trees as the combined number of trees and stones, we have:
Number of birds = 2 * 200
Number of birds = 400

So, there are 400 birds in the trees."
"Chris has twelve marbles, and Ryan has some marbles. They put marbles together in a pile and then each takes away 1/4 of marbles from the pile. There are 20 marbles remaining in the pile. How many marbles does Ryan have?","Let's denote the number of marbles Ryan has as R.

When Chris and Ryan put their marbles together, the total number of marbles in the pile is Chris's marbles plus Ryan's marbles, which is 12 + R.

They each take away 1/4 of the marbles from the pile. Since they both take away the same amount, together they take away 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 of the marbles.

The number of marbles remaining in the pile after they both take their share is therefore 1/2 of the original pile. We know that there are 20 marbles remaining, so the original pile before they took their share was twice that amount:

20 marbles * 2 = 40 marbles

This means that the total number of marbles before they took any away was 40. We can now set up the equation:

12 + R = 40

Now, we solve for R:

R = 40 - 12
R = 28

Ryan has 28 marbles."
"Sara has already saved 4100 dollars, and she plans to save a certain amount each week. Jim plans to save 15 dollars a week. In 820 weeks, Jim and Sara will have saved the same amount. How much does Sara plan to save each week?","Let's denote the amount Sara plans to save each week as \( S \).

Sara has already saved $4100, and she will save \( S \) dollars each week for 820 weeks. So, the total amount Sara will have saved after 820 weeks is:
\[ 4100 + 820S \]

Jim plans to save $15 each week for 820 weeks. So, the total amount Jim will have saved after 820 weeks is:
\[ 15 \times 820 \]

According to the problem, after 820 weeks, Jim and Sara will have saved the same amount. Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 4100 + 820S = 15 \times 820 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 820S = 15 \times 820 - 4100 \]
\[ 820S = 12300 - 4100 \]
\[ 820S = 8200 \]
\[ S = \frac{8200}{820} \]
\[ S = 10 \]

So, Sara plans to save $10 each week."
"For the school's fifth-grade play, the auditorium has three seating sections. In section A, there are 25 rows with 17 chairs in each row. In section B, the middle section, there are 30 rows, but the number of chairs per row varies: the first row has 20 chairs, and each subsequent row has two additional chairs more than the previous row. Finally, in section C, there are 29 rows, with the first row containing 16 chairs, and then decreasing by one chair in each subsequent row till the last row. Calculate the total number of chairs put out for the play.","Let's calculate the number of chairs in each section one by one.

**Section A:**
There are 25 rows with 17 chairs in each row. So the total number of chairs in section A is:
25 rows * 17 chairs/row = 425 chairs

**Section B:**
In section B, the number of chairs increases by 2 for each subsequent row. This forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a1) is 20 chairs, the common difference (d) is 2 chairs, and the number of terms (n) is 30 rows.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is:
S = n/2 * (2a1 + (n - 1)d)

Plugging in the values for section B:
S = 30/2 * (2*20 + (30 - 1)*2)
S = 15 * (40 + 29*2)
S = 15 * (40 + 58)
S = 15 * 98
S = 1470 chairs

**Section C:**
In section C, the number of chairs decreases by 1 for each subsequent row, which is also an arithmetic sequence but with a negative common difference. The first term (a1) is 16 chairs, the common difference (d) is -1 chair, and the number of terms (n) is 29 rows.

Using the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence:
S = n/2 * (2a1 + (n - 1)d)

Plugging in the values for section C:
S = 29/2 * (2*16 + (29 - 1)*(-1))
S = 29/2 * (32 - 28)
S = 29/2 * 4
S = 29 * 2
S = 58 chairs

Now, let's add up the chairs from all three sections:
Total chairs = Chairs in section A + Chairs in section B + Chairs in section C
Total chairs = 425 + 1470 + 58
Total chairs = 1953 chairs

Therefore, the total number of chairs put out for the play is 1953."
"A man is purchasing a pair of sneakers at a club store where he receives a certain membership discount off any purchase. In addition to the membership discount, the man also has a coupon for $10 off any pair of sneakers. The man wants to purchase a $120 pair of sneakers and the membership discount must be applied after the coupon. He pays $99 for the sneakers after using both the coupon and membership discount. What is the membership discount percentage?","First, we apply the $10 coupon to the original price of the sneakers, which is $120.

$120 - $10 = $110

Now, the sneakers cost $110 after the coupon is applied.

The man pays $99 after the membership discount is applied to the $110 price.

To find the membership discount percentage, we need to calculate the difference between the price after the coupon and the price he pays:

$110 - $99 = $11

This $11 is the amount saved from the membership discount.

Now, to find the percentage discount, we divide the amount saved by the price after the coupon and multiply by 100:

($11 / $110) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the membership discount percentage is 10%."
"In an election, there are four candidates: A, B, C, and D. Candidate A received 45% of the total valid votes, Candidate B received 30% of the total valid votes, Candidate C received 20% of the total valid votes, and Candidate D received 5% of the total valid votes. If 25% of the total votes were declared invalid and the total number of votes is 1,000,000, find the number of valid votes polled in favor of each candidate.","First, let's find out the number of valid votes. Since 25% of the total votes were declared invalid, the remaining 75% of the votes are valid. 

Total votes = 1,000,000
Percentage of valid votes = 100% - 25% = 75%

Number of valid votes = Total votes * Percentage of valid votes
Number of valid votes = 1,000,000 * 75/100
Number of valid votes = 750,000

Now, let's calculate the number of valid votes polled in favor of each candidate:

Candidate A received 45% of the total valid votes:
Votes for Candidate A = Number of valid votes * 45/100
Votes for Candidate A = 750,000 * 45/100
Votes for Candidate A = 337,500

Candidate B received 30% of the total valid votes:
Votes for Candidate B = Number of valid votes * 30/100
Votes for Candidate B = 750,000 * 30/100
Votes for Candidate B = 225,000

Candidate C received 20% of the total valid votes:
Votes for Candidate C = Number of valid votes * 20/100
Votes for Candidate C = 750,000 * 20/100
Votes for Candidate C = 150,000

Candidate D received 5% of the total valid votes:
Votes for Candidate D = Number of valid votes * 5/100
Votes for Candidate D = 750,000 * 5/100
Votes for Candidate D = 37,500

So, the number of valid votes polled in favor of each candidate is as follows:
- Candidate A: 337,500 votes
- Candidate B: 225,000 votes
- Candidate C: 150,000 votes
- Candidate D: 37,500 votes"
Bianca was practicing for a marathon. To prepare she ran some miles the first day and 4 miles the next day. Bianca ran altogether 12 miles. How many miles did she run the first day?,"Let's call the number of miles Bianca ran the first day ""x"". 

According to the information given, Bianca ran ""x"" miles the first day and 4 miles the next day, which adds up to a total of 12 miles. 

So the equation to represent this situation is:

x + 4 = 12

To find out how many miles Bianca ran the first day, we need to solve for ""x"". 

Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate ""x"":

x + 4 - 4 = 12 - 4

This simplifies to:

x = 8

So, Bianca ran 8 miles the first day."
"Find the area of the trapezium whose parallel sides are 26 cm and 18 cm long, the distance between them is 15 cm, and the angle between the shorter parallel side and one of the non-parallel sides is 35 degrees. Additionally, find the lengths of the non-parallel sides.","To find the area of the trapezium, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is:

Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) * (distance between the parallel sides)

Let's denote the longer parallel side as a = 26 cm, the shorter parallel side as b = 18 cm, and the distance between them as h = 15 cm.

Area = (1/2) * (a + b) * h
Area = (1/2) * (26 cm + 18 cm) * 15 cm
Area = (1/2) * 44 cm * 15 cm
Area = 22 cm * 15 cm
Area = 330 cm²

So, the area of the trapezium is 330 cm².

Now, let's find the lengths of the non-parallel sides. We can use trigonometry to find the length of the non-parallel side adjacent to the shorter parallel side (let's call it c). Since we have the angle between the shorter parallel side and one of the non-parallel sides (35 degrees), we can use the tangent function:

tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent

In this case, the opposite side is the distance between the parallel sides (h = 15 cm), and the angle θ is 35 degrees.

tan(35°) = h/c
c = h / tan(35°)
c = 15 cm / tan(35°)

Now, let's calculate the length of side c:

c ≈ 15 cm / 0.7002 (approximate value of tan(35°))
c ≈ 21.42 cm

The length of the non-parallel side adjacent to the shorter parallel side is approximately 21.42 cm.

To find the length of the other non-parallel side (let's call it d), we can use the Pythagorean theorem if we know the length of the perpendicular from the angle to the longer parallel side. However, we don't have that information, so we cannot directly calculate the length of side d without additional information.

If we assume that the trapezium is an isosceles trapezium (which means the non-parallel sides are equal), then d would also be approximately 21.42 cm. However, without the assumption of an isosceles trapezium or additional information, we cannot determine the length of side d."

60 - 24 = 36 new socks.

So, George bought 36 new socks."
"Jack orders 4 sandwiches. The first two sandwiches cost $5 each with a 10% discount, the third sandwich costs $6 with a 15% discount, and the fourth sandwich costs $7 with no discount. A 5% tax is applied to the total cost after the discounts are applied, and a flat service fee of $2 is added. Jack pays with a $20 bill, a $10 bill, and four $1 coins. How much change does he get?","First, let's calculate the cost of each sandwich after the discounts:

1. The first two sandwiches cost $5 each with a 10% discount:
   Discount for each sandwich = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50
   Cost after discount for each sandwich = $5 - $0.50 = $4.50
   Total cost for two sandwiches = 2 * $4.50 = $9

2. The third sandwich costs $6 with a 15% discount:
   Discount for the third sandwich = 15% of $6 = 0.15 * $6 = $0.90
   Cost after discount for the third sandwich = $6 - $0.90 = $5.10

3. The fourth sandwich costs $7 with no discount:
   Cost for the fourth sandwich = $7

Now, let's add up the cost of all sandwiches after discounts:
Total cost after discounts = $9 + $5.10 + $7 = $21.10

Next, we apply the 5% tax to the total cost after discounts:
Tax = 5% of $21.10 = 0.05 * $21.10 = $1.055
Since tax is usually rounded to the nearest cent, the tax would be $1.06.

Now, let's add the tax to the total cost after discounts:
Total cost with tax = $21.10 + $1.06 = $22.16

Then, we add the flat service fee of $2:
Total cost with service fee = $22.16 + $2 = $24.16

Jack pays with a $20 bill, a $10 bill, and four $1 coins, which totals:
Payment = $20 + $10 + 4 * $1 = $30 + $4 = $34

Finally, let's calculate the change Jack gets:
Change = Payment - Total cost with service fee = $34 - $24.16 = $9.84

Jack gets $9.84 in change."
The sum of all possible numbers formed from 3 different one-digit natural numbers when divided by the sum of the original 3 numbers is equal to 22. What type of numbers are formed from the 3 different one-digit natural numbers?,"Let's denote the three different one-digit natural numbers as a, b, and c.

The possible numbers formed by these three digits are the permutations of the three digits taken all at a time. There are 3! (3 factorial) such permutations, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 permutations. The permutations are:

1. abc
2. acb
3. bac
4. bca
5. cab
6. cba

The sum of all these permutations is:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100a + 10c + b) + (100b + 10a + c) + (100b + 10c + a) + (100c + 10a + b) + (100c + 10b + a)

Grouping like terms, we get:

= (100a + 100a + 100b + 100b + 100c + 100c) + (10b + 10c + 10a + 10c + 10a + 10b) + (c + b + c + a + b + a)

= 200(a + b + c) + 20(a + b + c) + 2(a + b + c)

= 222(a + b + c)

According to the problem, the sum of all possible numbers formed divided by the sum of the original 3 numbers is equal to 22:

222(a + b + c) / (a + b + c) = 22

Simplifying, we get:

222 = 22

This is not possible because 222 is not equal to 22. There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement as it stands. The sum of all permutations of three different one-digit numbers cannot be 22 times the sum of the original numbers because the factor we derived (222) is not equal to 22. Please check the problem statement again."
"Faye had $20. Today, her mother gave her some money. She bought ten cupcakes at $1.50 each and five boxes of cookies at $3 per box. She had $30 left. What is the ratio of the money her mother gave her to the money Faye had initially?","First, let's calculate the total amount Faye spent on cupcakes and cookies.

For cupcakes: 10 cupcakes * $1.50 per cupcake = $15
For cookies: 5 boxes * $3 per box = $15

Total spent = $15 (cupcakes) + $15 (cookies) = $30

Now, let's find out how much money Faye had after her mother gave her some and before she made her purchases. We know she had $30 left after buying the cupcakes and cookies, and she spent $30 on them, so:

Money Faye had after her mother gave her some = $30 (left) + $30 (spent) = $60

Now, let's find out how much money her mother gave her:

Money her mother gave her = $60 (after) - $20 (initially) = $40

Finally, we can find the ratio of the money her mother gave her to the money Faye had initially:

Ratio = Money her mother gave her : Money Faye had initially
Ratio = $40 : $20
Ratio = 40/20
Ratio = 2/1
Ratio = 2:1

So, the ratio of the money her mother gave her to the money Faye had initially is 2:1."
"In a box, there are some orange, 7 black and 6 white balls. If one ball is picked up randomly, the probability that it is neither orange nor white is 0.38095238095238093. How many orange balls are there in the box?","Let's denote the number of orange balls as O.

The total number of balls in the box is the sum of the orange, black, and white balls, which is O + 7 + 6.

The probability that a ball picked at random is neither orange nor white is the probability that it is black. Since there are 7 black balls, the probability of picking a black ball is:

P(black) = Number of black balls / Total number of balls
P(black) = 7 / (O + 7 + 6)

We are given that P(black) = 0.38095238095238093. So we can set up the equation:

7 / (O + 7 + 6) = 0.38095238095238093

Now we can solve for O:

7 / (O + 13) = 0.38095238095238093
7 = 0.38095238095238093 * (O + 13)
7 = 0.38095238095238093 * O + 0.38095238095238093 * 13

Now we solve for O:

7 = 0.38095238095238093 * O + 4.952380952380952
7 - 4.952380952380952 = 0.38095238095238093 * O
2.047619047619048 = 0.38095238095238093 * O

O = 2.047619047619048 / 0.38095238095238093
O ≈ 5.375

Since the number of balls must be a whole number, we round O to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are approximately 5 orange balls in the box."
"A family's water, electricity, and gas bills average $35 a month for the first 5 months. For the following 4 months, their average monthly bill drops to $25. After that, in the last 3 months, they average $30 a month. If the family's bills were averaged over the entire 12 months, what would the average monthly bill be?","To find the average monthly bill over the entire 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount spent on bills for the year and then divide by 12.

For the first 5 months, the average monthly bill is $35. So, the total for these months is:
5 months * $35/month = $175

For the next 4 months, the average monthly bill is $25. So, the total for these months is:
4 months * $25/month = $100

For the last 3 months, the average monthly bill is $30. So, the total for these months is:
3 months * $30/month = $90

Now, we add up the totals for all three periods to get the total for the year:
$175 + $100 + $90 = $365

Finally, we divide the total for the year by the number of months to get the average monthly bill over the 12 months:
$365 / 12 months = $30.42 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the average monthly bill over the entire 12 months is approximately $30.42."
"when magnified 1,000 times by an electron microscope , the image of a certain circular piece of tissue has a diameter of 0.3 centimeter . the actual diameter of the tissue , in centimeters , is","To find the actual diameter of the tissue, we need to divide the magnified diameter by the magnification factor.

Given:
Magnified diameter = 0.3 centimeters
Magnification factor = 1,000 times

Actual diameter = Magnified diameter / Magnification factor
Actual diameter = 0.3 cm / 1,000
Actual diameter = 0.0003 cm

So, the actual diameter of the tissue is 0.0003 centimeters."
"A library experiences varying visitor rates across different days of the week and seasonal or monthly fluctuations. On Sundays, the library has an average of 510 visitors. On Mondays and Tuesdays, the average number of visitors is 240, while on Wednesdays and Thursdays, it increases to 300. On Fridays and Saturdays, the number of visitors drops to 200. During the summer months of June, July, and August, the visitor rate increases by 20%. In the winter months of December, January, and February, it decreases by 15%. If the month considered is November, which has 30 days and starts on a Sunday, find the average number of visitors per day throughout that month.","To find the average number of visitors per day throughout November, we need to calculate the total number of visitors for the month and then divide by the number of days in the month.

Since November starts on a Sunday, the distribution of days will be as follows:

- 5 Sundays
- 4 Mondays
- 4 Tuesdays
- 4 Wednesdays
- 4 Thursdays
- 4 Fridays
- 4 Saturdays

Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors for each day of the week:

- Sundays: 5 days * 510 visitors/day = 2550 visitors
- Mondays: 4 days * 240 visitors/day = 960 visitors
- Tuesdays: 4 days * 240 visitors/day = 960 visitors
- Wednesdays: 4 days * 300 visitors/day = 1200 visitors
- Thursdays: 4 days * 300 visitors/day = 1200 visitors
- Fridays: 4 days * 200 visitors/day = 800 visitors
- Saturdays: 4 days * 200 visitors/day = 800 visitors

Now, let's sum these up to get the total number of visitors for the month:

Total visitors = 2550 + 960 + 960 + 1200 + 1200 + 800 + 800 = 8470 visitors

Since November is not a summer or winter month as defined, we do not adjust the visitor rate for seasonal fluctuations.

Finally, we find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days in November:

Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days in November
Average visitors per day = 8470 visitors / 30 days
Average visitors per day = 282.33 visitors/day

Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this to the nearest whole number:

Average visitors per day ≈ 282 visitors/day"
"what is the smallest 5 digit number that is divisible by 15 , 32 , 45 , and 54 ?","To find the smallest 5-digit number that is divisible by 15, 32, 45, and 54, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. However, since the LCM will give us the smallest number that all of them divide, we need to ensure that the LCM is a 5-digit number.

First, let's find the prime factorization of each number:

- 15 = 3 × 5
- 32 = 2^5
- 45 = 3^2 × 5
- 54 = 2 × 3^3

Now, to find the LCM, we take the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of each number:

- The highest power of 2 is 2^5 (from 32).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^3 (from 54).
- The highest power of 5 is 5^1 (from 15 and 45).

So, the LCM = 2^5 × 3^3 × 5 = 32 × 27 × 5 = 8640.

However, 8640 is not a 5-digit number. We need to find the smallest 5-digit multiple of 8640. Since 8640 is a 4-digit number, the smallest 5-digit number we can get by multiplying it by an integer is by multiplying it by 10 (the smallest two-digit number), which would give us 86400.

86400 is divisible by 15, 32, 45, and 54, and it is the smallest 5-digit number that meets the criteria."

"In 1979, approximately 1/3 of the 37.3 million airline passengers traveling to or from the United States used Kennedy airport. If the number of such passengers that used Miami airport was 1/4 the number that used Kennedy airport, but 3 times the number that used Logan airport, approximately how many millions of these passengers used Logan airport that year? Additionally, if 6 times the passengers that used Logan airport had a layover at Austin airport and 1/2 of the passengers that had a layover at Austin airport also had a connecting flight from Heartfield airport, approximately how many millions of these passengers had their flight connected from Heartfield airport that year?","First, let's find out how many passengers used Kennedy airport:

1/3 of 37.3 million is:
(1/3) * 37.3 million = 12.433... million

Now, let's find out how many passengers used Miami airport:

1/4 of the number that used Kennedy airport is:
(1/4) * 12.433... million = 3.10825 million

Since the number of passengers that used Logan airport is 1/3 of the number that used Miami airport, we can find this number by dividing the Miami airport number by 3:

3.10825 million / 3 = 1.036083... million

So, approximately 1.036 million passengers used Logan airport.

Now, if 6 times the passengers that used Logan airport had a layover at Austin airport, then:

6 * 1.036 million = 6.216 million

And if 1/2 of the passengers that had a layover at Austin airport also had a connecting flight from Heartfield airport, then:

1/2 * 6.216 million = 3.108 million

So, approximately 3.108 million passengers had their flight connected from Heartfield airport that year."
"The average (arithmetic mean) of all scores on a certain algebra test was 90. If the average of the 8 male students’ grades was 83, and the average of the female students’ grades was some value, then 28 female students took the test. What was the average grade of the female students?","Let's denote the average grade of the female students as \( F \).

The total score for the male students is \( 8 \times 83 \) because there are 8 male students each with an average score of 83.

The total score for the female students is \( 28 \times F \) because there are 28 female students each with an average score of \( F \).

The total number of students is \( 8 + 28 = 36 \).

The overall average score is 90, so the total score for all students is \( 36 \times 90 \).

Now we can set up an equation to solve for \( F \):

\[ 8 \times 83 + 28 \times F = 36 \times 90 \]

\[ 664 + 28F = 3240 \]

Now, solve for \( F \):

\[ 28F = 3240 - 664 \]

\[ 28F = 2576 \]

\[ F = \frac{2576}{28} \]

\[ F = 92 \]

So, the average grade of the female students was 92."
"In a car dealership, Fiona works for 40 hours a week at a rate of $20 per hour, John works for 30 hours a week at a rate of $22 per hour, Jeremy works for 25 hours a week at a rate of $18 per hour, Katie works for 35 hours a week at a rate of $21 per hour, and Matt works for 28 hours a week at a rate of $19 per hour. How much money does their boss spend paying all of them every month, assuming there are 4 weeks in a month?","To calculate the monthly pay for each employee, we first calculate their weekly pay and then multiply by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

Fiona's weekly pay = 40 hours * $20/hour = $800
Fiona's monthly pay = $800 * 4 = $3200

John's weekly pay = 30 hours * $22/hour = $660
John's monthly pay = $660 * 4 = $2640

Jeremy's weekly pay = 25 hours * $18/hour = $450
Jeremy's monthly pay = $450 * 4 = $1800

Katie's weekly pay = 35 hours * $21/hour = $735
Katie's monthly pay = $735 * 4 = $2940

Matt's weekly pay = 28 hours * $19/hour = $532
Matt's monthly pay = $532 * 4 = $2128

Now, we add up the monthly pay for all employees to find out how much their boss spends on their salaries every month.

Total monthly pay = Fiona's monthly pay + John's monthly pay + Jeremy's monthly pay + Katie's monthly pay + Matt's monthly pay
Total monthly pay = $3200 + $2640 + $1800 + $2940 + $2128
Total monthly pay = $12708

Therefore, their boss spends $12,708 paying all of them every month."
A retailer bought a coat at wholesale for $120 and marked it up 125% to its initial price. By how many more dollars does the retailer need to increase the price to achieve a 150% markup?,"First, let's calculate the initial price the retailer set after a 125% markup.

A 125% markup on the wholesale price means the coat was marked up by 125% of $120.

Markup = (125/100) * $120
Markup = 1.25 * $120
Markup = $150

So, the initial price of the coat after a 125% markup was:

Initial Price = Wholesale Price + Markup
Initial Price = $120 + $150
Initial Price = $270

Now, let's calculate the price the retailer needs to set to achieve a 150% markup.

A 150% markup on the wholesale price means the coat would be marked up by 150% of $120.

Markup for 150% = (150/100) * $120
Markup for 150% = 1.5 * $120
Markup for 150% = $180

So, the price of the coat after a 150% markup would be:

Price for 150% Markup = Wholesale Price + Markup for 150%
Price for 150% Markup = $120 + $180
Price for 150% Markup = $300

To find out how many more dollars the retailer needs to increase the price to achieve a 150% markup, we subtract the initial price from the price for 150% markup:

Increase Needed = Price for 150% Markup - Initial Price
Increase Needed = $300 - $270
Increase Needed = $30

The retailer needs to increase the price by an additional $30 to achieve a 150% markup."
Axel bought an aquarium that was marked down 50% from an original price of $120. He also paid additional sales tax equal to 5% of the reduced price. What was the total cost of the aquarium?,"First, let's calculate the reduced price of the aquarium after the 50% markdown.

Original price of the aquarium = $120
Markdown percentage = 50%

The markdown in dollars is 50% of $120, which is calculated as:
Markdown = (50/100) * $120 = 0.5 * $120 = $60

So, the reduced price of the aquarium after the markdown is:
Reduced price = Original price - Markdown
Reduced price = $120 - $60 = $60

Next, we calculate the sales tax, which is 5% of the reduced price.

Sales tax percentage = 5%
Sales tax in dollars = 5% of $60, which is calculated as:
Sales tax = (5/100) * $60 = 0.05 * $60 = $3

Finally, we add the sales tax to the reduced price to find the total cost of the aquarium.

Total cost = Reduced price + Sales tax
Total cost = $60 + $3 = $63

Therefore, the total cost of the aquarium, including the sales tax, is $63."

He wouldn't be home until 5 pm because of baseball practice. He knew dinner would take 45 minutes, and he figured his homework would take a certain amount of time to finish. He needed to clean his room, which would take 30 minutes; then take out the trash, which would take about 5 minutes; and empty the dishwasher, which would take another 10 minutes. If the latest time that Justin could start his chores and homework to be done by 8 pm to watch his movie was 6 pm, how long did he think his homework would take?","Justin has from 6 pm until 8 pm to finish his chores and homework, which gives him a total of 2 hours, or 120 minutes.

He has three chores to do:
- Cleaning his room: 30 minutes
- Taking out the trash: 5 minutes
- Emptying the dishwasher: 10 minutes

Adding up the time for chores:
30 minutes + 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 45 minutes

Now, subtract the time for chores from the total time available:
120 minutes - 45 minutes = 75 minutes

Justin has 75 minutes left for his homework. Therefore, he figured his homework would take 75 minutes to finish."
"The price of 3 pants and 6 t-shirts is Rs. 2250. With the same money, one can buy 1 pant and 12 t-shirts. If one wants to buy 8 t-shirts, how much shall she have to pay?","Let the price of one pant be P and the price of one t-shirt be T.

According to the first condition, the price of 3 pants and 6 t-shirts is Rs. 2250:
3P + 6T = 2250  (Equation 1)

According to the second condition, with the same money, one can buy 1 pant and 12 t-shirts:
P + 12T = 2250  (Equation 2)

Now, we have two equations with two variables. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of P and T.

First, let's solve Equation 2 for P:
P = 2250 - 12T  (Equation 3)

Now, we can substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1 to solve for T:
3(2250 - 12T) + 6T = 2250
6750 - 36T + 6T = 2250
-30T = 2250 - 6750
-30T = -4500
T = -4500 / -30
T = 150

Now that we have the price of one t-shirt (T), we can find the price of 8 t-shirts:
8T = 8 * 150
8T = 1200

Therefore, the price of 8 t-shirts is Rs. 1200."
"At a restaurant, glasses are stored in two different-sized boxes. One box contains 12 glasses, and the other contains 16 glasses. The average number of glasses per box is some number, and there are 16 more of the larger boxes. The total number of glasses at the restaurant is 480. What is the average number of glasses per box?","Let's denote the number of smaller boxes as \( S \) and the number of larger boxes as \( L \). We are given that \( L = S + 16 \).

The total number of glasses is given by the sum of the glasses in the smaller boxes and the glasses in the larger boxes, which is \( 480 \). So we can write the equation:

\[ 12S + 16L = 480 \]

We also know that there are 16 more larger boxes than smaller boxes, so we can write:

\[ L = S + 16 \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( 12S + 16L = 480 \)
2. \( L = S + 16 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to find the number of smaller boxes:

\[ 12S + 16(S + 16) = 480 \]
\[ 12S + 16S + 256 = 480 \]
\[ 28S + 256 = 480 \]
\[ 28S = 480 - 256 \]
\[ 28S = 224 \]
\[ S = \frac{224}{28} \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Now that we have the number of smaller boxes, we can find the number of larger boxes:

\[ L = S + 16 \]
\[ L = 8 + 16 \]
\[ L = 24 \]

Now we can find the total number of boxes:

\[ \text{Total number of boxes} = S + L \]
\[ \text{Total number of boxes} = 8 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Total number of boxes} = 32 \]

Finally, we can find the average number of glasses per box by dividing the total number of glasses by the total number of boxes:

\[ \text{Average number of glasses per box} = \frac{\text{Total number of glasses}}{\text{Total number of boxes}} \]
\[ \text{Average number of glasses per box} = \frac{480}{32} \]
\[ \text{Average number of glasses per box} = 15 \]

So the average number of glasses per box is 15."
"After 100 new people move into a town, 400 of the original population move out. Every year afterward, the town’s population is halved. After 4 years, the population is a certain number of people. Before the new people moved in, 780 people lived in the town. What was the population after 4 years?","Let's calculate the population step by step:

1. 100 new people move into the town:
   Original population = 780
   New population after 100 people move in = 780 + 100 = 880

2. 400 of the original population move out:
   Population after 400 people move out = 880 - 400 = 480

3. The population is halved every year for 4 years:
   After 1st year: 480 / 2 = 240
   After 2nd year: 240 / 2 = 120
   After 3rd year: 120 / 2 = 60
   After 4th year: 60 / 2 = 30

"Carrie's mom gave her $91 to go shopping. She bought a sweater, a T-shirt for $6, and a pair of shoes for $11. Carrie has $50 left. How much did the sweater cost?","Carrie started with $91 and has $50 left after shopping. To find out how much she spent, we subtract the amount she has left from the amount she started with:

$91 - $50 = $41

This $41 is the total amount spent on the sweater, T-shirt, and shoes. We know the T-shirt cost $6 and the shoes cost $11. To find the cost of the sweater, we subtract the cost of the T-shirt and shoes from the total amount spent:

$41 - $6 (T-shirt) - $11 (shoes) = $24

Therefore, the sweater cost $24."
"Dave was making ice using three different ice trays. In Tray A, he had 2 ice cubes but decided to make 7 more cubes. Tray B had 1/3 of the total number of cubes in Tray A. In Tray C, Dave had made ice cubes twice the amount in Tray A after it was filled. What is the total number of ice cubes Dave had in all three trays?","First, let's find out how many ice cubes Tray A has after Dave decided to make 7 more cubes.

Tray A initially had 2 cubes, and he made 7 more, so:
Tray A = 2 + 7 = 9 cubes

Tray B has 1/3 of the total number of cubes in Tray A, so:
Tray B = 1/3 * 9 = 3 cubes

Tray C has twice the amount in Tray A after it was filled, so:
Tray C = 2 * 9 = 18 cubes

Now, let's find the total number of ice cubes in all three trays:
Total = Tray A + Tray B + Tray C
Total = 9 (Tray A) + 3 (Tray B) + 18 (Tray C)
Total = 9 + 3 + 18
Total = 30 cubes

Dave had a total of 30 ice cubes in all three trays."
"Olivia gave William 10 napkins. Amelia also gives William twice the number of napkins Olivia gave him. William had a certain number of napkins before, and now he has 45 napkins. How many napkins did William have before?","Olivia gave William 10 napkins. Amelia gives William twice the number of napkins Olivia gave him, which is 2 * 10 = 20 napkins.

The total number of napkins William received from both Olivia and Amelia is 10 (from Olivia) + 20 (from Amelia) = 30 napkins.

William now has 45 napkins in total. To find out how many napkins he had before, we subtract the number of napkins he received from the total number he has now:

45 (total napkins now) - 30 (napkins received) = 15 napkins.

Therefore, William had 15 napkins before Olivia and Amelia gave him more."

"What is the least number that should be subtracted from 929, so that the difference is completely divisible by a large prime number like 47?","To find the least number that should be subtracted from 929 so that the difference is completely divisible by 47, we need to find the remainder when 929 is divided by 47. The number that we need to subtract will be equal to this remainder.

Let's perform the division:

929 ÷ 47 = 19 remainder 44

This means that when 929 is divided by 47, the remainder is 44. Therefore, we need to subtract 44 from 929 to make it completely divisible by 47.

So the least number that should be subtracted from 929 is 44."
"If 50 apprentices can finish a job in 4 hours, and some journeymen can finish the same job in 5 hours, then 10 apprentices and 15 journeymen should be able to complete 0.15000000000000002 of the job in one hour. How many journeymen can finish the job in 5 hours?","Let's first find out the work rate of the apprentices and the journeymen.

If 50 apprentices can finish a job in 4 hours, then the work rate of the apprentices (A) is:
Work rate of A = 1 job / (50 apprentices * 4 hours) = 1/200 apprentice-hour

Now, let's assume that J journeymen can finish the same job in 5 hours. Then the work rate of the journeymen (J) is:
Work rate of J = 1 job / (J journeymen * 5 hours) = 1/(5J) journeyman-hour

Now, we are told that 10 apprentices and 15 journeymen can complete 0.15 of the job in one hour. Using the work rates we found, we can write the equation for the combined work of 10 apprentices and 15 journeymen in one hour as follows:
(10 apprentices * 1/200 apprentice-hour) + (15 journeymen * 1/(5J) journeyman-hour) = 0.15 job

Solving for J, we get:
(10/200) + (15/(5J)) = 0.15
(1/20) + (3/J) = 0.15
3/J = 0.15 - 1/20
3/J = 0.15 - 0.05
3/J = 0.10
J = 3/0.10
J = 30

Therefore, 30 journeymen can finish the job in 5 hours."
"You sold 40 toys on Day 1. On Day 2, you sold 4 times the number of toys sold on Day 1. Find out the number of toys you sold more on Day 2 compared to Day 1.","On Day 2, you sold 4 times the number of toys sold on Day 1. So, if you sold 40 toys on Day 1, then on Day 2 you sold:

4 times 40 = 160 toys

To find out how many more toys you sold on Day 2 compared to Day 1, subtract the number of toys sold on Day 1 from the number of toys sold on Day 2:

160 toys (Day 2) - 40 toys (Day 1) = 120 toys

So, you sold 120 more toys on Day 2 compared to Day 1."

A lawn care company bought 4 lawnmower blades for $8 each. They also bought a spool of weed eater string for $7. How much money did they spend on supplies?,"The lawn care company spent $8 on each lawnmower blade and bought 4 of them, so the total cost for the blades is:

4 blades * $8/blade = $32

They also bought a spool of weed eater string for $7.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on supplies is:

Cost of blades + Cost of string = $32 + $7 = $39

The lawn care company spent $39 on supplies."
"The ratio of money with Ram and Gopal is some ratio, and that with Gopal and Krishan is the same ratio. Ram has Rs. 490, and Krishan has Rs. 2890. What is the ratio of money with Ram and Gopal, and Gopal and Krishan?","Let's denote the ratio of money with Ram and Gopal as R:G and the ratio of money with Gopal and Krishan as G:K. We are given that R:G = G:K and that Ram has Rs. 490 and Krishan has Rs. 2890.

Since R:G = G:K, we can write this as R/G = G/K.

We can express G in terms of R and K in terms of G using the ratios:

G = R * (G/R)
K = G * (K/G)

We know that R = 490 and K = 2890. We can substitute these values into the equation G = R * (G/R) to find the value of G:

G = 490 * (G/490)

Similarly, we can substitute the values into the equation K = G * (K/G) to find the value of G:

2890 = G * (2890/G)

Now we have two equations with G in them:

1) G = 490 * (G/490)
2) 2890 = G * (2890/G)

From equation 2, we can simplify to find G:

G^2 = 2890 * 490
G = √(2890 * 490)

Now we can calculate the value of G:

G = √(1418100)
G = 1190

Now we have the values of R, G, and K:

R = 490
G = 1190
K = 2890

The ratio of money with Ram and Gopal (R:G) is 490:1190, which can be simplified by dividing both numbers by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 490 and 1190. The GCD of 490 and 1190 is 10.

So, the simplified ratio R:G is 49:119.

Since R:G = G:K, the ratio of money with Gopal and Krishan (G:K) is also 49:119.

Therefore, the ratio of money with Ram and Gopal, and Gopal and Krishan is 49:119."
"A sum is lent at compound interest at a certain rate per annum and amounts to Rs. 240 in 2 years. If the sum amounts to Rs. 217.68707482993196, what is the rate of interest per annum?","Let's denote the principal amount (the initial sum lent) as P, the rate of interest per annum as r (in decimal form), and the amount after 2 years as A1 (which is Rs. 240) and the amount after 1 year as A2 (which is Rs. 217.68707482993196).

The formula for compound interest for 1 year is:
\[ A2 = P(1 + r) \]

And for 2 years, it is:
\[ A1 = P(1 + r)^2 \]

We can use these two equations to solve for P and r.

First, let's solve for P using the amount after 1 year (A2):
\[ 217.68707482993196 = P(1 + r) \]
\[ P = \frac{217.68707482993196}{1 + r} \] (Equation 1)

Now, let's use the amount after 2 years (A1) to create another equation:
\[ 240 = P(1 + r)^2 \]
\[ 240 = \left(\frac{217.68707482993196}{1 + r}\right)(1 + r)^2 \]
\[ 240 = 217.68707482993196(1 + r) \]

Now, we can divide both sides by 217.68707482993196 to solve for (1 + r):
\[ \frac{240}{217.68707482993196} = 1 + r \]
\[ 1 + r = \frac{240}{217.68707482993196} \]
\[ 1 + r = 1.1025 \] (approximately)

Now, we can solve for r:
\[ r = 1.1025 - 1 \]
\[ r = 0.1025 \]

To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ r = 0.1025 \times 100 \]
\[ r = 10.25\% \]

So, the rate of interest per annum is approximately 10.25%."
There are multi-colored pens in the stationery store. 3/10 of the pens in the stationery store are red and 1/5 are black. There are 12 red pens in the stationery store. Find how many black pens are in the stationery store.,"If 3/10 of the pens are red and there are 12 red pens, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of pens (T):

(3/10) * T = 12

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 3/10:

T = 12 / (3/10)
T = 12 * (10/3)
T = 120/3
T = 40

So, there are 40 pens in total in the stationery store.

Now, we know that 1/5 of the pens are black. To find the number of black pens (B), we use the total number of pens (T):

B = (1/5) * T
B = (1/5) * 40
B = 8

Therefore, there are 8 black pens in the stationery store."
Reema took a loan of Rs 1200 with simple interest. She paid Rs. 432 as interest at the end of the loan period. The rate of interest was 6%. For how many years did she take the loan?,"To find out for how many years Reema took the loan, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100

We know the Simple Interest (SI) is Rs. 432, the Principal (P) is Rs. 1200, and the Rate (R) is 6%. We need to find the Time (T).

Let's plug in the values we know:

432 = (1200 × 6 × T) / 100

To find T, we first multiply 1200 by 6:

1200 × 6 = 7200

Now we have:

432 = (7200 × T) / 100

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get rid of the denominator:

432 × 100 = 7200 × T

43200 = 7200 × T

Now, we divide both sides by 7200 to solve for T:

T = 43200 / 7200

T = 6

So, Reema took the loan for 6 years."
The average of 6 quantities is 8. The average of some of them is 5. The average of the remaining 2 numbers is 14. How many quantities have an average of 5?,"Let's denote the total number of quantities that have an average of 5 as \( n \).

The sum of the 6 quantities is \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

The sum of the \( n \) quantities with an average of 5 is \( n \times 5 \).

The sum of the remaining 2 numbers with an average of 14 is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \).

Since the sum of all the quantities is 48, we can write the equation:

\( n \times 5 + 28 = 48 \)

Now, let's solve for \( n \):

\( 5n = 48 - 28 \)

\( 5n = 20 \)

\( n = \frac{20}{5} \)

\( n = 4 \)

So, there are 4 quantities that have an average of 5."
"A marketing survey of Anytown found that the ratio of trucks to sedans to motorcycles was 3 : 7 : 2, respectively. Given that there are a certain number of sedans in Anytown, there are 2,600 motorcycles. How many sedans are there in Anytown?","Let's denote the number of sedans as S, the number of trucks as T, and the number of motorcycles as M. According to the ratio given, we have:

T : S : M = 3 : 7 : 2

We are given that there are 2,600 motorcycles, so M = 2,600. We can use the ratio to find the number of sedans (S). The ratio of sedans to motorcycles is 7 : 2, which means for every 2 motorcycles, there are 7 sedans.

We can set up a proportion to find the number of sedans:

S / M = 7 / 2

Substituting the given value of M:

S / 2,600 = 7 / 2

Cross-multiplying to solve for S:

S * 2 = 2,600 * 7

S = (2,600 * 7) / 2

S = 18,200 / 2

S = 9,100

Therefore, there are 9,100 sedans in Anytown."
"of the two square fields , the area of the one is 1 hectare , while anothe one is broader by 1 % . there differences in area is :","Let's denote the side length of the first square field as \( s \) meters. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = s^2 \), and we know that the area of the first field is 1 hectare, we can write:

\[ s^2 = 1 \text{ hectare} \]

Since 1 hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters, we can convert the area to square meters:

\[ s^2 = 10,000 \text{ m}^2 \]

Now, let's find the side length \( s \) of the first field:

\[ s = \sqrt{10,000} \]
\[ s = 100 \text{ m} \]

The second field is broader by 1%, so its side length \( s_2 \) is 1% greater than \( s \):

\[ s_2 = s + 0.01s \]
\[ s_2 = 1.01s \]
\[ s_2 = 1.01 \times 100 \text{ m} \]
\[ s_2 = 101 \text{ m} \]

The area of the second field is:

\[ \text{Area}_2 = s_2^2 \]
\[ \text{Area}_2 = (101 \text{ m})^2 \]
\[ \text{Area}_2 = 10,201 \text{ m}^2 \]

The difference in area between the two fields is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Area}_2 - \text{Area}_1 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 10,201 \text{ m}^2 - 10,000 \text{ m}^2 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 201 \text{ m}^2 \]

So, the difference in area between the two fields is 201 square meters."
A ratio between two numbers is 3 : 4 and their LCM is 84. What is the first number?,"Let's denote the two numbers as 3x and 4x, where x is the common multiplier. According to the given information, the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers is 84.

Since the LCM of two numbers in the ratio 3:4 (which are 3x and 4x) would be the product of the largest number in the ratio and the common multiplier x, we can write:

LCM = 4x

Given that the LCM is 84, we can set up the equation:

4x = 84

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 84 / 4
x = 21

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the first number (which is 3x):

First number = 3 * x
First number = 3 * 21
First number = 63

Therefore, the first number is 63."
"John and Mike enter into a partnership by investing $700 and $300 respectively. At the end of one year, they divided their profits such that a third of the profit is divided equally for the efforts they have put into the business and the remaining amount of profit is divided in the ratio of the investments they made in the business. John received some amount more than Mike did. The profit made by their business in that year was $3000.0000000000005. How much more did John receive than Mike?","First, let's divide the profit into two parts: one-third for their efforts and two-thirds for their investments.

Total profit = $3000.0000000000005

One-third for efforts = 1/3 * $3000.0000000000005 = $1000.0000000000002
Two-thirds for investments = 2/3 * $3000.0000000000005 = $2000.0000000000003

The $1000.0000000000002 for efforts is divided equally between John and Mike, so they each get:

$1000.0000000000002 / 2 = $500.0000000000001

Now, let's divide the $2000.0000000000003 according to their investments. The total investment is $700 (John) + $300 (Mike) = $1000.

John's share of the investment = $700 / $1000 = 7/10
Mike's share of the investment = $300 / $1000 = 3/10

So, John's share of the $2000.0000000000003 profit is:

7/10 * $2000.0000000000003 = $1400.0000000000002

And Mike's share of the $2000.0000000000003 profit is:

3/10 * $2000.0000000000003 = $600.0000000000001

Now, let's add the effort share to the investment share for each person:

John's total = $500.0000000000001 (effort) + $1400.0000000000002 (investment) = $1900.0000000000003
Mike's total = $500.0000000000001 (effort) + $600.0000000000001 (investment) = $1100.0000000000002

The difference between John's and Mike's total is:

$1900.0000000000003 - $1100.0000000000002 = $800.0000000000001

So, John received $800.0000000000001 more than Mike."
"A driver goes on a trip of 60 kilometers, the first 30 kilometers at a certain speed and the remaining distance at 30 kilometers per hour. The average speed of the entire trip is 40 kilometers per hour. What is the speed of the first part of the trip?","Let's denote the speed of the first part of the trip as \( v \) km/h.

The time taken to cover the first 30 kilometers at speed \( v \) is \( \frac{30}{v} \) hours.

The time taken to cover the remaining 30 kilometers at 30 km/h is \( \frac{30}{30} = 1 \) hour.

The total time for the trip is the sum of the time for the first part and the second part, so:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{30}{v} + 1 \text{ hours} \]

The average speed for the entire trip is given as 40 km/h. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance of the trip is 60 kilometers, so:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]
\[ 40 = \frac{60}{\frac{30}{v} + 1} \]

Now we solve for \( v \):
\[ 40 = \frac{60}{\frac{30}{v} + 1} \]
\[ 40 \left( \frac{30}{v} + 1 \right) = 60 \]
\[ \frac{1200}{v} + 40 = 60 \]
\[ \frac{1200}{v} = 20 \]
\[ 1200 = 20v \]
\[ v = \frac{1200}{20} \]
\[ v = 60 \text{ km/h} \]

So, the speed of the first part of the trip is 60 km/h."
"a man spends 35 % of his income on food , 25 % on children education and 80 % of the remaining on house rent . what percent of his income he is left with ?","Let's assume the man's total income is 100 units (it could be dollars, euros, etc., but we'll use units for simplicity).

He spends 35% on food, so he spends 35 units on food.

He spends 25% on children's education, so he spends 25 units on education.

After these expenses, he has spent a total of 35 (food) + 25 (education) = 60 units.

This leaves him with 100 - 60 = 40 units of his income.

Now, he spends 80% of the remaining 40 units on house rent. So he spends 0.80 * 40 = 32 units on rent.

After paying for rent, he is left with 40 - 32 = 8 units.

Therefore, he is left with 8% of his original income."
A sum of money put at compound interest amounts in 2 years to Rs. 8880 and in 3 years to Rs. 9261. What is the initial sum of money?,"Let's denote the initial sum of money as P, the rate of compound interest as r (in decimal form), and the number of years as n. According to the compound interest formula, the amount A after n years is given by:

A = P(1 + r)^n

We are given that the amount after 2 years is Rs. 8880 and after 3 years is Rs. 9261. We can set up two equations based on this information:

1) 8880 = P(1 + r)^2
2) 9261 = P(1 + r)^3

We can use these two equations to solve for P and r. First, let's find the ratio of the amounts after 3 years to the amount after 2 years to find r:

(9261 / 8880) = (P(1 + r)^3) / (P(1 + r)^2)

By simplifying, we get:

(9261 / 8880) = (1 + r)

Now, let's calculate the ratio:

9261 / 8880 ≈ 1.0429

So, we have:

1 + r ≈ 1.0429

Now, we can solve for r:

r ≈ 1.0429 - 1
r ≈ 0.0429

Now that we have the approximate value of r, we can substitute it back into either equation 1 or 2 to find P. Let's use equation 1:

8880 = P(1 + 0.0429)^2

Now, calculate (1 + 0.0429)^2:

(1 + 0.0429)^2 ≈ 1.0876

Substitute this back into the equation:

8880 = P * 1.0876

Now, solve for P:

P = 8880 / 1.0876
P ≈ 8160

Therefore, the initial sum of money (P) is approximately Rs. 8160."

"Purple Valley has one-quarter as many skirts as Seafoam Valley, and Seafoam Valley has a certain ratio of skirts compared to Azure Valley. If Azure Valley has 60 skirts and Purple Valley has 10 skirts, what is the ratio of skirts in Seafoam Valley to skirts in Azure Valley?","If Purple Valley has 10 skirts and this is one-quarter of the number of skirts in Seafoam Valley, then Seafoam Valley has 4 times as many skirts as Purple Valley. 

So, Seafoam Valley has 10 skirts * 4 = 40 skirts.

Now, we need to find the ratio of skirts in Seafoam Valley to skirts in Azure Valley. Azure Valley has 60 skirts.

The ratio is Seafoam Valley skirts : Azure Valley skirts = 40 skirts : 60 skirts.

To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 20 in this case.

40 skirts / 20 = 2
60 skirts / 20 = 3

So, the simplified ratio of skirts in Seafoam Valley to skirts in Azure Valley is 2:3."
"A store had 3 packs of paper for $3.87. If you were to buy a certain number of packs, it would cost $7.74. How many packs of paper can you buy for $7.74?","To find out how many packs of paper you can buy for $7.74, we need to divide the total cost by the cost of one pack.

First, we need to find the cost of one pack of paper. Since 3 packs cost $3.87, we divide $3.87 by 3 to get the cost of one pack:

$3.87 ÷ 3 = $1.29 per pack

Now, we can find out how many packs you can buy for $7.74 by dividing $7.74 by the cost of one pack:

$7.74 ÷ $1.29 = 6 packs

So, you can buy 6 packs of paper for $7.74."
"if the price of white sugar rises from Rs. 6 per kg to Rs. 7.50 per kg and the price of brown sugar rises from Rs. 8 per kg to Rs. 9.75 per kg, while the price of powdered sugar rises from Rs. 10 per kg to Rs. 11.50 per kg, a person, to have no increase in his total expenditure on sugar, will have to reduce his consumption of each type of sugar by","To determine how much the person will have to reduce their consumption of each type of sugar to have no increase in their total expenditure, we need to calculate the percentage increase in the price of each type of sugar and then determine the reduction in consumption needed to offset this increase.

Let's calculate the percentage increase in the price for each type of sugar:

1. White sugar:
Old price = Rs. 6 per kg
New price = Rs. 7.50 per kg
Percentage increase = [(New price - Old price) / Old price] * 100
Percentage increase = [(7.50 - 6) / 6] * 100
Percentage increase = (1.50 / 6) * 100
Percentage increase = 0.25 * 100
Percentage increase = 25%

2. Brown sugar:
Old price = Rs. 8 per kg
New price = Rs. 9.75 per kg
Percentage increase = [(9.75 - 8) / 8] * 100
Percentage increase = (1.75 / 8) * 100
Percentage increase = 0.21875 * 100
Percentage increase = 21.875%

3. Powdered sugar:
Old price = Rs. 10 per kg
New price = Rs. 11.50 per kg
Percentage increase = [(11.50 - 10) / 10] * 100
Percentage increase = (1.50 / 10) * 100
Percentage increase = 0.15 * 100
Percentage increase = 15%

Now, to maintain the same expenditure, the person must reduce their consumption by the same percentage as the price increase. This is because the expenditure is the product of price and quantity. If the price increases by a certain percentage, the quantity must decrease by the same percentage to keep the expenditure constant.

Therefore, the person will have to reduce their consumption of:
- White sugar by 25%
- Brown sugar by 21.875%
- Powdered sugar by 15%"
"Zain has 10 more of each coin than Emerie. If Zain has 48 coins, and Emerie has six quarters and five nickels, how many dimes does Emerie have?","Let's first find out how many coins Emerie has in total. We know that Emerie has six quarters and five nickels, which makes a total of 6 + 5 = 11 coins that we know of.

Since Zain has 10 more coins than Emerie, and Zain has 48 coins, we can calculate the total number of coins Emerie has by subtracting 10 from Zain's total. So, Emerie has 48 - 10 = 38 coins in total.

We already know that 11 of these coins are quarters and nickels, so to find out how many dimes Emerie has, we subtract the known coins from the total number of coins Emerie has.

38 (total coins) - 11 (quarters and nickels) = 27 coins.

\( x + y = 24 \) (since the two parts add up to 24)

We are also given that 7 times the first part added to 5 times the second part makes a certain sum, which can be written as:

\( 7x + 5y = \text{sum} \)

We are told that the first part, \( x \), is 13.0. So we can substitute \( x \) with 13.0 in both equations:

\( 13.0 + y = 24 \)

Now, we can solve for \( y \):

\( y = 24 - 13.0 \)
\( y = 11.0 \)

Now that we have the value of \( y \), we can find the sum by substituting \( x \) and \( y \) into the second equation:

\( 7x + 5y = \text{sum} \)
\( 7(13.0) + 5(11.0) = \text{sum} \)
\( 91 + 55 = \text{sum} \)
\( \text{sum} = 146 \)

Therefore, the sum is 146."
"There were 50 people on the city bus. At the first stop, 15 people got off. At the next stop, 8 people got off and some people got on. At the third stop, 4 people got off and 3 people got on. There are 28 people on the bus after the third stop. How many people got on at the second stop?","Let's calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initial number of people on the bus: 50

After the first stop, 15 people got off, so:
50 - 15 = 35 people remained on the bus.

At the second stop, 8 people got off, so:
35 - 8 = 27 people remained on the bus before some people got on.

Let's call the number of people who got on at the second stop x.

So after the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
27 + x

At the third stop, 4 people got off and 3 people got on, so the change in the number of people is:
-4 (got off) + 3 (got on) = -1

Therefore, after the third stop, the number of people on the bus is:
(27 + x) - 1 = 26 + x

We know that there are 28 people on the bus after the third stop, so:
26 + x = 28

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 28 - 26
x = 2

So, 2 people got on at the second stop."
"The ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack follow a certain pattern. The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. The ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack are 7. What is the pattern of their ages?","Let's denote the ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack as P, M, and J, respectively. We are given that the sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. This can be written as:

P + M = J - 5

We are also given that the ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack are 7. This means that the sum of their ages is 7:

P + M + J = 7

Now, we have two equations:

1) P + M = J - 5
2) P + M + J = 7

We can substitute the first equation into the second to find the value of J:

P + M + (P + M + 5) = 7
2(P + M) + 5 = 7
2(P + M) = 7 - 5
2(P + M) = 2

Divide both sides by 2:

P + M = 1

Now we know that the sum of Peter and Margaret's ages is 1. Since we are looking for a pattern, let's consider the simplest case where Peter is 0 years old and Margaret is 1 year old. This would satisfy the equation P + M = 1.

Now let's find Jack's age using the first equation:

P + M = J - 5
0 + 1 = J - 5
J = 1 + 5
J = 6

So, Jack is 6 years old.

The pattern of their ages is that Peter is 0 years old, Margaret is 1 year old, and Jack is 6 years old. This satisfies both the given conditions:

- The sum of Peter and Margaret's ages (0 + 1) equals Jack's age before 5 years (6 - 5).
- The total of their ages (0 + 1 + 6) equals 7."
"There were some people in the party, 1/3 left the party. Then 2/5 of the remaining left the party, then 2/3 of the remaining left the party. At last, 10 people were remaining. How many people were in total at the party?","Let's denote the total number of people at the party as P.

After 1/3 of the people left, the remaining number of people is:
Remaining after first departure = P - (1/3)P = (2/3)P

Then, 2/5 of the remaining people left the party:
Remaining after second departure = (2/3)P - (2/5)(2/3)P = (2/3)P * (3/5) = (2/5)P

After that, 2/3 of the remaining people left the party:
Remaining after third departure = (2/5)P - (2/3)(2/5)P = (2/5)P * (1/3) = (2/15)P

At the end, there were 10 people remaining:
(2/15)P = 10

Now, we can solve for P:
P = 10 * (15/2)
P = 10 * 7.5
P = 75

So, there were 75 people in total at the party."
"The average of 6 numbers is 3.9. The average of two of them is a certain value, while the average of the other two is 3.85. The average of the remaining two numbers is 4.45. What is the average of the first two numbers?","Let's denote the average of the first two numbers as \( A \).

The average of 6 numbers is 3.9, so the sum of these 6 numbers is \( 6 \times 3.9 \).

The average of the second set of two numbers is 3.85, so their sum is \( 2 \times 3.85 \).

The average of the third set of two numbers is 4.45, so their sum is \( 2 \times 4.45 \).

Now, we can write an equation for the sum of all 6 numbers:

\[ 6 \times 3.9 = 2 \times A + 2 \times 3.85 + 2 \times 4.45 \]

First, let's calculate the sum of all 6 numbers:

\[ 6 \times 3.9 = 23.4 \]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the second and third pairs of numbers:

\[ 2 \times 3.85 = 7.7 \]
\[ 2 \times 4.45 = 8.9 \]

Adding these sums together:

\[ 7.7 + 8.9 = 16.6 \]

Now, we can find the sum of the first two numbers by subtracting the sum of the second and third pairs from the total sum:

\[ 23.4 - 16.6 = 6.8 \]

Since this is the sum of the first two numbers, to find their average \( A \), we divide by 2:

\[ A = \frac{6.8}{2} = 3.4 \]

Therefore, the average of the first two numbers is 3.4."
"the average ( arithmetic mean ) of the integers from 100 to 400 , inclusive , is how much greater than the average of the integers from 50 to 250 , inclusive ?","To find the average of a set of consecutive integers, you can take the average of the first and last numbers in the set. 

For the integers from 100 to 400, the average is:
(100 + 400) / 2 = 500 / 2 = 250

For the integers from 50 to 250, the average is:
(50 + 250) / 2 = 300 / 2 = 150

Now, to find out how much greater the average of the first set is compared to the second set, we subtract the average of the second set from the average of the first set:
250 - 150 = 100

So, the average of the integers from 100 to 400 is 100 greater than the average of the integers from 50 to 250."
A train 50 m long passes a platform of a certain length in 10 seconds. The speed of the train is 15 m/sec. What is the length of the platform?,"To find the length of the platform, we first need to determine the distance the train covers while passing the platform. Since the speed of the train is given as 15 m/sec, and it takes 10 seconds to pass the platform, we can calculate the distance covered by the train during this time as follows:

Distance covered by the train = Speed of the train × Time taken to pass the platform
Distance covered by the train = 15 m/sec × 10 sec
Distance covered by the train = 150 m

This distance includes the length of the train itself plus the length of the platform. Since the length of the train is given as 50 m, we can find the length of the platform by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance covered:

Length of the platform = Distance covered by the train - Length of the train
Length of the platform = 150 m - 50 m
Length of the platform = 100 m

Therefore, the length of the platform is 100 meters."
How many moles of HCl are required to react with some moles of NaOH to form 2 moles of NaCl along with 2 moles of H2O? (Assume the reaction is balanced),"The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O) is:

HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O

From the balanced equation, we can see that the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1:1:1, meaning that 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH to produce 1 mole of NaCl and 1 mole of H2O.

If you want to produce 2 moles of NaCl, you will also produce 2 moles of H2O, because the ratio of NaCl to H2O in the balanced equation is 1:1.

Therefore, you will need 2 moles of HCl to react with 2 moles of NaOH to produce 2 moles of NaCl and 2 moles of H2O."
"In a group of four numbers, the sum of the numbers is 1,056. If the first number is twice the second number, the third number is one-third of the first number, and the fourth number is the average of the first and second numbers, find the value of each number in the group.","Let's denote the second number as x. According to the problem, the first number is twice the second number, so the first number is 2x.

The third number is one-third of the first number, so the third number is (1/3) * 2x = (2/3)x.

The fourth number is the average of the first and second numbers, so the fourth number is (2x + x) / 2 = (3/2)x.

Now we have all four numbers in terms of x:
1st number: 2x
2nd number: x
3rd number: (2/3)x
4th number: (3/2)x

The sum of these four numbers is given as 1,056:
2x + x + (2/3)x + (3/2)x = 1,056

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms. First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6. We can rewrite the equation as:
(12/6)x + (6/6)x + (4/6)x + (9/6)x = 1,056

Now, combine the terms:
(12x + 6x + 4x + 9x) / 6 = 1,056

(31x) / 6 = 1,056

Multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the denominator:
31x = 1,056 * 6

31x = 6,336

Now, divide both sides by 31 to solve for x:
x = 6,336 / 31

x = 204

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of each number:
1st number: 2x = 2 * 204 = 408
2nd number: x = 204
3rd number: (2/3)x = (2/3) * 204 = 136
4th number: (3/2)x = (3/2) * 204 = 306

So the four numbers are 408, 204, 136, and 306."
"A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, while at an altitude of 1500 feet, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. During the following hour, the balloon ascends to an altitude of 3500 feet, causing 30% of the remaining balloons to blow up due to pressure changes. Meanwhile, the wind speed increases, creating a variation in the rate at which balloons blow up. Additionally, balloons inflated at different times show varying durability. Out of the balloons still intact, 10% have double durability and are less likely to blow up in the same conditions. At the end of the second hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up, excluding the more durable ones, also blow up, as the wind speed decreases. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 200 balloons in the hot air balloon.
2. After half an hour, 1/5 of the balloons have blown up. This means 200 * 1/5 = 40 balloons have blown up, leaving 200 - 40 = 160 balloons intact.
3. During the following hour, the balloon ascends to an altitude of 3500 feet, causing 30% of the remaining balloons to blow up. This means 160 * 30% = 48 balloons have blown up, leaving 160 - 48 = 112 balloons intact.
4. Out of the remaining 112 balloons, 10% have double durability. This means 112 * 10% = 11.2, but since we can't have a fraction of a balloon, we'll round down to 11 balloons with double durability.
5. At the end of the second hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up, excluding the more durable ones, also blow up. We've had 40 + 48 = 88 balloons blow up so far, and we need to exclude the more durable ones, which are 11. So we have 88 - 11 = 77 balloons that are not durable. Twice this number is 77 * 2 = 154 balloons that blow up.

However, we cannot have more balloons blowing up than we have left, so we need to check if we have 154 balloons left to blow up. We had 112 balloons intact before this last event, so we can only blow up all 112 balloons, not 154.

Since all the remaining balloons blow up, there are 0 balloons left intact."
abcd is a square aegf is a rectangle . . such that the rectangle shares 25 % of the area of the suare also ae lies on the line ab and ag lies on segment of ad . if the square shares half the area of the rectangle what is the ratio ae : ag ?,"Let's denote the side length of the square ABCD as \( s \). Since AEFG is a rectangle that shares 25% of the area of the square, the area of the rectangle is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the area of the square.

The area of the square is \( s^2 \), so the area of the rectangle AEFG is \( \frac{1}{4} s^2 \).

Now, we are given that the square shares half the area of the rectangle. This means that the area of the square is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the area of the rectangle. However, we know that the area of the square is \( s^2 \), so we have:

\[ s^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{(Area of rectangle)} \]
\[ s^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4} s^2 \]
\[ s^2 = \frac{1}{8} s^2 \]

This is a contradiction because it implies that \( s^2 \) is both equal to itself and to \( \frac{1}{8} \) of itself, which is not possible unless \( s^2 = 0 \), which would mean the square has no area, which is not the case.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. The square cannot share half the area of the rectangle if the rectangle already shares 25% of the area of the square. The two conditions are incompatible. Please check the problem statement again and provide the correct information so that we can help you solve the problem."
"Codger is a three-footed sloth.  He has a challenging time buying shoes because the stores only sell the shoes in pairs. If he already owns the 3-piece set of shoes he is wearing, how many pairs of shoes does he need to buy to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes?","If Codger already owns one 3-piece set of shoes, he needs 4 more sets to have a total of 5 sets. Since each set consists of 3 shoes, he needs 4 sets x 3 shoes/set = 12 shoes.

Shoes are sold in pairs, so each pair consists of 2 shoes. To get 12 shoes, Codger needs to buy 12 shoes ÷ 2 shoes/pair = 6 pairs of shoes."
"The length of a rectangular plot is some multiple of its breadth. The area of the rectangular plot is 363 sq m, and the breadth of the rectangular plot is 11 m. What is the ratio of the length to the breadth of the rectangular plot?","Let's denote the breadth of the rectangular plot as \( b \) and the length as \( l \). We are given that \( b = 11 \) m and the area \( A \) of the rectangle is \( A = l \times b = 363 \) sq m.

Since we know the breadth \( b \), we can find the length \( l \) by dividing the area by the breadth:

\[ l = \frac{A}{b} = \frac{363}{11} \]

\[ l = 33 \]

Now we have the length \( l = 33 \) m and the breadth \( b = 11 \) m. The ratio of the length to the breadth is:

\[ \frac{l}{b} = \frac{33}{11} \]

\[ \frac{l}{b} = 3 \]

So the ratio of the length to the breadth of the rectangular plot is 3:1."
"a, b, and c rent a pasture for Rs. 841. a put in 12 horses for a certain number of months, b put in 16 horses for 9 months, and c put in 18 horses for 6 months. b should pay Rs. 348. For how many months did a put in the horses?","Let's denote the number of months that a put in the horses as x.

The total cost of the pasture is Rs. 841, and we know that the cost is divided among a, b, and c based on the number of horses they put in and for how long they put them in.

The cost for a is proportional to the product of the number of horses (12) and the number of months (x), which is 12x.
The cost for b is proportional to the product of the number of horses (16) and the number of months (9), which is 16*9.
The cost for c is proportional to the product of the number of horses (18) and the number of months (6), which is 18*6.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for a, b, and c:
Total cost = Cost for a + Cost for b + Cost for c
841 = 12x + 16*9 + 18*6

We know that b should pay Rs. 348, which means:
Cost for b = 16*9 = 348

Now we can solve for x:
841 = 12x + 348 + 18*6
841 = 12x + 348 + 108
841 - 348 - 108 = 12x
385 = 12x
x = 385 / 12
x = 32.0833

Since the number of months cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole month:
x = 32 months

Therefore, a put in the horses for 32 months."
"At a family gathering, a mother has to bring ice pops to five children who are playing outside. In the freezer, she has 5 cherry ice pops, 4 orange ice pops, 3 lime ice pops, 3 strawberry ice pops, and 2 grape ice pops. If she chooses five ice pops at random to bring outside to the children, but realizes that she cannot bring them different flavors without one child getting jealous of the others and causing a scene, what is the probability that she has to return to the freezer to switch out some ice pops to make sure that all children receive the same flavor?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the mother picks 5 ice pops of the same flavor in one go. If she can't do that, she'll have to return to the freezer to switch out some ice pops.

There are a total of 5 cherry, 4 orange, 3 lime, 3 strawberry, and 2 grape ice pops, making a total of 17 ice pops.

The probability of picking 5 ice pops of the same flavor in one go is the sum of the probabilities of picking 5 of each individual flavor.

The probability of picking 5 cherry ice pops is:
P(5 cherry) = (5/17) * (4/16) * (3/15) * (2/14) * (1/13)

However, since there are not enough of the other flavors to make a set of 5, the probabilities for those are zero:
P(5 orange) = 0 (because there are only 4 orange ice pops)
P(5 lime) = 0 (because there are only 3 lime ice pops)
P(5 strawberry) = 0 (because there are only 3 strawberry ice pops)
P(5 grape) = 0 (because there are only 2 grape ice pops)

Now, let's calculate P(5 cherry):
P(5 cherry) = (5/17) * (4/16) * (3/15) * (2/14) * (1/13)
P(5 cherry) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13)
P(5 cherry) = 120 / 571,440
P(5 cherry) = 1 / 4,762

Since the probabilities for the other flavors are zero, the total probability of picking 5 of the same flavor is just the probability of picking 5 cherry ice pops.

Therefore, the probability that she has to return to the freezer to switch out some ice pops to make sure that all children receive the same flavor is:
1 - P(5 cherry)
= 1 - (1 / 4,762)
≈ 1 - 0.00021
≈ 0.99979

So, there is approximately a 99.979% chance that the mother will have to return to the freezer to switch out some ice pops to ensure all children receive the same flavor."
The speed of a boat in still water is 36 kmph. What is the speed of the stream if the boat can cover 80 km downstream or 40 km upstream in the same time?,"Let the speed of the stream be \( v \) kmph.

When the boat is going downstream, its effective speed is the sum of its own speed and the speed of the stream, which is \( 36 + v \) kmph.

When the boat is going upstream, its effective speed is the difference between its own speed and the speed of the stream, which is \( 36 - v \) kmph.

The time taken to cover a certain distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed. So, the time taken to cover 80 km downstream is \( \frac{80}{36 + v} \) hours, and the time taken to cover 40 km upstream is \( \frac{40}{36 - v} \) hours.

According to the problem, these times are equal, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{80}{36 + v} = \frac{40}{36 - v} \]

Now, we can solve for \( v \):

\[ 80(36 - v) = 40(36 + v) \]
\[ 2880 - 80v = 1440 + 40v \]
\[ 2880 - 1440 = 80v + 40v \]
\[ 1440 = 120v \]
\[ v = \frac{1440}{120} \]
\[ v = 12 \]

So, the speed of the stream is 12 kmph."
"Kenneth spent a certain percentage of his earnings this week on a new joystick. After that, he was left with $405. His earnings were $450. What percentage of his earnings did he spend on the joystick?","To find out the percentage of his earnings that Kenneth spent on the joystick, we first need to determine how much he spent on the joystick. We can do this by subtracting the amount he was left with from his total earnings:

Amount spent on joystick = Total earnings - Amount left
Amount spent on joystick = $450 - $405
Amount spent on joystick = $45

Now that we know Kenneth spent $45 on the joystick, we can calculate the percentage of his total earnings that this represents:

Percentage spent on joystick = (Amount spent on joystick / Total earnings) * 100
Percentage spent on joystick = ($45 / $450) * 100
Percentage spent on joystick = 0.1 * 100
Percentage spent on joystick = 10%

Kenneth spent 10% of his earnings on the joystick."
The swimming club went to a swim meet in another town. They took 2 cars and 3 vans. There were 5 people in each car and 3 people in each van. Each car can hold a maximum of some people and each van can hold a maximum of 8 people. They could have taken 17 more people with the swim team. What is the maximum capacity of each car?,"Let's first calculate the total number of people who went to the swim meet:

There were 2 cars with 5 people in each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 people in cars.
There were 3 vans with 3 people in each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 people in vans.
In total, there were 10 + 9 = 19 people who went to the swim meet.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of people they could have taken:

Each van can hold a maximum of 8 people, and there were 3 vans, so the maximum number of people for the vans is 3 * 8 = 24 people.
They could have taken 17 more people with the swim team, so the total maximum capacity for the cars and vans together is 19 (people who went) + 17 (additional people they could have taken) = 36 people.

Since we already know the maximum capacity for the vans is 24 people, we can subtract that from the total maximum capacity to find the maximum capacity for the cars:

36 (total maximum capacity) - 24 (maximum capacity for vans) = 12 people for the cars.

There were 2 cars, so we divide the maximum capacity for the cars by the number of cars to find the maximum capacity per car:

12 (maximum capacity for cars) / 2 (number of cars) = 6 people per car.

Therefore, the maximum capacity of each car is 6 people."
"In a certain parallelogram, the degree measure of one angle exceeds that of the other by 40. What is the degree measure of the smaller angle?","In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.

Let's denote the smaller angle as x degrees. Then, the larger angle, which exceeds the smaller by 40 degrees, would be x + 40 degrees.

Since adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, we can write the following equation:

x + (x + 40) = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 40 = 180

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

2x = 140

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 70

Therefore, the degree measure of the smaller angle is 70 degrees."
Andrew's 4 friends decided to bring food as well. Each of them brought 4 slices of pizza. How many slices of pizza do they have in total?,"If each of Andrew's 4 friends brought 4 slices of pizza, then the total number of slices they brought is:

So, they have 16 slices of pizza in total."
"The average weight of a, b, and c is 45 kg. If the average weight of a and b is some kg and that of b and c is 41 kg, and the weight of b is 27 kg, what is the average weight of a and b?","Let's denote the weight of a, b, and c as A, B, and C respectively.

Given that the average weight of a, b, and c is 45 kg, we can write the following equation:

(A + B + C) / 3 = 45

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

A + B + C = 135  (Equation 1)

We are also given that the average weight of b and c is 41 kg, so we can write:

(B + C) / 2 = 41

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

B + C = 82  (Equation 2)

We are given that the weight of b is 27 kg, so we can substitute B with 27 in Equation 2:

27 + C = 82

Solving for C, we get:

C = 82 - 27
C = 55 kg

Now we can substitute the value of C back into Equation 1 to find the weight of a:

A + 27 + 55 = 135

Solving for A, we get:

A + 82 = 135
A = 135 - 82
A = 53 kg

Now that we have the weights of a and b, we can find the average weight of a and b:

(A + B) / 2 = (53 + 27) / 2
(A + B) / 2 = 80 / 2
(A + B) / 2 = 40 kg

Therefore, the average weight of a and b is 40 kg."
"By travelling at 40 kmph, a person reaches his destination on time. He covered a certain fraction of the total distance in one-third of the total time. He should maintain a speed of 20 kmph for the remaining distance to reach his destination on time. What fraction of the total distance did he cover initially?","Let's denote the total distance as D and the total time as T.

The person covers a certain fraction of the total distance in one-third of the total time. Let's call this fraction x. Therefore, he covers xD in T/3 time.

For the first part of the journey, he travels at 40 kmph. The distance covered at this speed is:
Distance = Speed × Time
xD = 40 × (T/3)

For the remaining distance, which is (1-x)D, he travels at 20 kmph. Since he uses the remaining two-thirds of the time for this part, the time taken is (2T/3). The distance covered at this speed is:
Distance = Speed × Time
(1-x)D = 20 × (2T/3)

Now, since he reaches his destination on time, the sum of the distances covered at both speeds should equal the total distance D. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

xD + (1-x)D = D

Substituting the expressions for xD and (1-x)D from above, we get:

40 × (T/3) + 20 × (2T/3) = D

Now, we can solve for x:

40 × (T/3) = xD
20 × (2T/3) = (1-x)D

Divide the second equation by the first to eliminate D and T:

(20 × (2T/3)) / (40 × (T/3)) = (1-x) / x
(20 × 2) / 40 = (1-x) / x
40 / 40 = (1-x) / x
1 = (1-x) / x

Now, solve for x:

x = 1 / (1 + 1)
x = 1 / 2

So, the fraction of the total distance he covered initially is 1/2 or 50%."
The monthly rent of a shop of dimension 18 feet × 22 feet is Rs. 2244. What is the annual rent per square foot of the shop?,"First, let's calculate the area of the shop in square feet:

Area = Length × Width
Area = 18 feet × 22 feet
Area = 396 square feet

Now, we have the monthly rent, which is Rs. 2244. To find the annual rent, we multiply the monthly rent by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

Annual Rent = Monthly Rent × 12
Annual Rent = Rs. 2244 × 12
Annual Rent = Rs. 26928

To find the annual rent per square foot, we divide the annual rent by the area of the shop:

Annual Rent per Square Foot = Annual Rent / Area
Annual Rent per Square Foot = Rs. 26928 / 396 square feet
Annual Rent per Square Foot = Rs. 68

Therefore, the annual rent per square foot of the shop is Rs. 68."
"Being concerned with the ecology of lakes, Hazel and her dad returned the youngling fishes they caught. They took 23 fishes from Lake Ontario and Erie, some fishes from Lake Huron and Michigan, and 44 from Lake Superior. They brought home 97 fishes with them. How many fishes did they take from Lake Huron and Michigan?","To find out how many fishes Hazel and her dad took from Lake Huron and Michigan, we need to subtract the number of fishes they returned to the lakes from the total number of fishes they brought home.

They returned 23 fishes to Lake Ontario and Erie, and 44 fishes to Lake Superior. So, the total number of fishes they returned is:

23 (Lake Ontario and Erie) + 44 (Lake Superior) = 67 fishes

Now, we know they brought home 97 fishes in total. To find out how many fishes they took from Lake Huron and Michigan, we subtract the number of fishes they returned from the total number they brought home:

97 (total fishes brought home) - 67 (fishes returned to other lakes) = 30 fishes

Therefore, Hazel and her dad took 30 fishes from Lake Huron and Michigan."
"A jar contains 9 blue pens, 21 black pens, and 6 red pens. Four blue pens are removed and then seven black pens are removed. How many pens are left in the jar?","Initially, there are a total of 9 blue pens + 21 black pens + 6 red pens = 36 pens in the jar.

After removing 4 blue pens, there are 9 - 4 = 5 blue pens left.

After removing 7 black pens, there are 21 - 7 = 14 black pens left.

So, the total number of pens left in the jar is 5 blue pens + 14 black pens + 6 red pens = 25 pens."
"a, b, and c rent a pasture for Rs. 435. a put in 12 horses for 8 months, b put in a certain number of horses for 9 months, and c put in 18 horses for 6 months. b should pay Rs. 180. How many horses did b put in?","Let's denote the number of horses b put in as H.

The total cost of the pasture is Rs. 435, and we know that b should pay Rs. 180 of that total. The cost is divided among a, b, and c based on the number of horses they put in and the number of months those horses stayed.

a put in 12 horses for 8 months, so a's share is 12 horses * 8 months = 96 horse-months.
b put in H horses for 9 months, so b's share is H horses * 9 months = 9H horse-months.
c put in 18 horses for 6 months, so c's share is 18 horses * 6 months = 108 horse-months.

The total horse-months for all three is 96 + 9H + 108.

Since the total cost is Rs. 435, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many horse-months correspond to b's payment of Rs. 180:

(9H horse-months) / (96 + 9H + 108 horse-months) = Rs. 180 / Rs. 435

Simplifying the denominator, we get:

9H / (204 + 9H) = 180 / 435

Cross-multiplying to solve for H, we get:

9H * 435 = 180 * (204 + 9H)
9H * 435 = 180 * 204 + 180 * 9H
9H * 435 = 36720 + 1620H

Now, we'll divide both sides by 9 to simplify:

H * 435 = 4080 + 180H

Next, we'll move the terms involving H to one side:

435H - 180H = 4080
255H = 4080

Now, we'll divide both sides by 255 to solve for H:

H = 4080 / 255
H = 16

So, b put in 16 horses."
"Gretzky Street begins at Orr Street and runs directly east for 5.6 kilometers until it meets Howe Street. Gretzky Street is intersected by perpendicular streets - Segment A streets intersect every 350 meters, Segment B streets intersect every 400 meters, and Segment C streets intersect every 450 meters.

Each of the Segment A streets, other than Orr Street and Howe Street, has a number beginning at 1st Street (one block east of Orr Street) and continuing consecutively (2nd Street, 3rd Street, etc.…). The Segment B streets are named B1st Street, B2nd Street, and so on, while the Segment C streets are named C1st Street, C2nd Street, and so on.

Determine the total number of intersections of Segment A, Segment B, and Segment C streets along Gretzky Street.","To determine the total number of intersections along Gretzky Street, we need to calculate the number of intersections for each segment type (A, B, and C) and then sum them up.

For Segment A streets:
Gretzky Street runs for 5.6 kilometers, and Segment A streets intersect every 350 meters. To find out how many Segment A streets intersect Gretzky Street, we divide the total distance by the distance between intersections:

5.6 km = 5600 meters
5600 meters / 350 meters/intersection = 16 intersections

Since Orr Street and Howe Street are not counted as Segment A streets, we subtract 2 from the total number of intersections:

16 - 2 = 14 Segment A intersections

For Segment B streets:
Again, Gretzky Street runs for 5.6 kilometers, and Segment B streets intersect every 400 meters. To find out how many Segment B streets intersect Gretzky Street, we divide the total distance by the distance between intersections:

5600 meters / 400 meters/intersection = 14 intersections

For Segment C streets:
Gretzky Street runs for 5.6 kilometers, and Segment C streets intersect every 450 meters. To find out how many Segment C streets intersect Gretzky Street, we divide the total distance by the distance between intersections:

5600 meters / 450 meters/intersection = 12.44 intersections

Since we can't have a fraction of an intersection, we round down to the nearest whole number:

12 intersections

Now, we sum up the intersections from each segment:

Segment A intersections: 14
Segment B intersections: 14
Segment C intersections: 12

Total intersections = 14 (Segment A) + 14 (Segment B) + 12 (Segment C) = 40 intersections

Therefore, there are a total of 40 intersections of Segment A, Segment B, and Segment C streets along Gretzky Street."
Kelly planted carrots in three different beds. In the first bed she pulled out some carrots. In the second bed she pulled out 101 carrots and in the third bed she pulled out 78 carrots. She found that 6 carrots weighed one pound. Kelly harvested 39 pounds of carrots. How many carrots did she pull out from the first bed?,"Kelly harvested 39 pounds of carrots, and since 6 carrots weigh one pound, we can calculate the total number of carrots harvested by multiplying the number of pounds by the number of carrots per pound:

39 pounds * 6 carrots/pound = 234 carrots

Kelly pulled out 101 carrots from the second bed and 78 carrots from the third bed, so we can subtract these from the total number of carrots to find out how many were pulled from the first bed:

234 total carrots - 101 carrots (second bed) - 78 carrots (third bed) = 55 carrots

So, Kelly pulled out 55 carrots from the first bed."
Sam grew some watermelons and then grew 3 more watermelons. Sam has 7 watermelons. How many watermelons did Sam grow initially?,"If Sam ended up with 7 watermelons after growing 3 more, we can find out how many watermelons Sam had initially by subtracting the 3 watermelons he grew later from the total.

7 watermelons (total) - 3 watermelons (grown later) = 4 watermelons (initially)

So, Sam grew 4 watermelons initially."
"The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. The total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300. If the two players scored a total of 60 goals, what is the ratio of the number of goals scored by each player?","Let's denote the number of goals scored by the first player as \( G_1 \) and the number of goals scored by the second player as \( G_2 \). According to the information given, \( G_1 + G_2 = 60 \) because together they scored 60 goals, which is 20% of all goals scored in the league against Barca.

Since 60 goals account for 20% of all goals scored in the league against Barca, we can calculate the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca as follows:

\( 20\% \times \text{Total Goals} = 60 \)

But we know the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca is 300, so:

\( 20\% \times 300 = 60 \)

This confirms that the 60 goals scored by the two players indeed account for 20% of all goals scored against Barca.

Now, to find the ratio of the number of goals scored by each player, we need additional information because there are multiple combinations of \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) that can add up to 60. Without knowing either \( G_1 \) or \( G_2 \), or the difference between the number of goals they scored, we cannot determine the exact ratio.

If we had, for example, \( G_1 = 40 \) and \( G_2 = 20 \), the ratio would be \( 40:20 \) or simplified, \( 2:1 \). But without such specific information, we cannot calculate the ratio."
"Taehyung's average score for Korean, English, and science is 95. When Taehyung says his average score dropped by 3 points after taking the math test, what is his math score?","To find Taehyung's math score, we first need to calculate his total score for Korean, English, and science before the math test. Since his average for these three subjects is 95, we can multiply this average by the number of subjects to find the total score:

Total score for Korean, English, and science = Average score × Number of subjects
Total score for Korean, English, and science = 95 × 3
Total score for Korean, English, and science = 285

Now, after taking the math test, his average dropped by 3 points, which means his new average is 95 - 3 = 92.

Since he now has scores for four subjects, we can calculate his new total score by multiplying the new average by the number of subjects:

New total score for all four subjects = New average score × Number of subjects
New total score for all four subjects = 92 × 4
New total score for all four subjects = 368

To find Taehyung's math score, we subtract the total score for the first three subjects from the new total score for all four subjects:

Math score = New total score for all four subjects - Total score for Korean, English, and science
Math score = 368 - 285
Math score = 83

Therefore, Taehyung's math score is 83."
A person lent a certain sum of money at 4% per annum at simple interest and in 8 years the interest amounted to a certain amount less than the sum lent. The sum lent was Rs. 500. How much less was the interest than the sum lent?,"To find out how much less the interest was than the sum lent, we first need to calculate the total interest earned over the 8 years.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal is the initial amount of money lent, which is Rs. 500 in this case.
- Rate is the annual interest rate, which is 4% or 0.04 as a decimal.
- Time is the number of years the money is lent for, which is 8 years.

Let's calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 500 \times 0.04 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 500 \times 0.32 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 160 \]

So, the total interest earned over 8 years is Rs. 160.

Now, we need to find out how much less this interest is than the sum lent, which is Rs. 500.

Difference = Sum lent - Interest
Difference = 500 - 160
Difference = 340

Therefore, the interest was Rs. 340 less than the sum lent."
"A, B, C, and D enter into a partnership. A invests some money at the beginning at an interest rate of 5% per annum, B invests 1.5 times the amount 4 months later at an interest rate of 7% per annum, C invests triple the initial amount 7 months later at an interest rate of 10% per annum, and D invests 2.5 times the initial amount after 9 months at an interest rate of 12% per annum. Given fluctuating monthly investments for each partner and irregular time intervals for their investments, if the total gain after 3 years is Rs. 75,000, what is A's share in the gain?","To calculate A's share in the gain, we need to determine the effective capital that each partner has invested over the 3-year period (36 months). We will calculate the interest for each partner as if it were a simple interest investment because we are not compounding the interest monthly or annually.

Let's assume A's initial investment is Rs. P.

A's investment:
A invests Rs. P for 36 months at 5% per annum.
Interest for A = P * 5% * 3 = 0.05 * P * 3

B's investment:
B invests 1.5P, but 4 months later, so for 32 months at 7% per annum.
Interest for B = 1.5P * 7% * (32/12) = 0.07 * 1.5P * (8/3)

C's investment:
C invests 3P, but 7 months later, so for 29 months at 10% per annum.
Interest for C = 3P * 10% * (29/12) = 0.10 * 3P * (29/12)

D's investment:
D invests 2.5P, but 9 months later, so for 27 months at 12% per annum.
Interest for D = 2.5P * 12% * (27/12) = 0.12 * 2.5P * (9/4)

Now, let's calculate the total gain from all partners' investments:

Total gain = Interest for A + Interest for B + Interest for C + Interest for D

Given that the total gain after 3 years is Rs. 75,000, we can set up the equation:

75,000 = (0.05 * P * 3) + (0.07 * 1.5P * (8/3)) + (0.10 * 3P * (29/12)) + (0.12 * 2.5P * (9/4))

Now, we need to solve for P:

75,000 = (0.15P) + (0.07 * 1.5P * 2.6667) + (0.10 * 3P * 2.4167) + (0.12 * 2.5P * 2.25)

75,000 = 0.15P + 0.35P + 0.725P + 0.675P

75,000 = 1.9P

P = 75,000 / 1.9
P = 39,473.68 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of P, we can calculate A's share in the gain:

A's share = Interest for A = 0.05 * P * 3
A's share = 0.05 * 39,473.68 * 3
A's share = 5,921.05 (approximately)

Therefore, A's share in the gain is approximately Rs. 5,921.05."
"Farmer Brown fed 7 chickens, 5 sheep, 10 grasshoppers, 3 spiders, 4 pigeons, and 2 kangaroos. How many total legs and wings were there among all the animals he fed?","To calculate the total number of legs and wings, we need to know the number of legs and wings each type of animal has:

- Chickens have 2 legs and 2 wings each.
- Sheep have 4 legs and no wings.
- Grasshoppers have 6 legs and 2 wings each.
- Spiders have 8 legs and no wings.
- Pigeons have 2 legs and 2 wings each.
- Kangaroos have 2 legs and no wings.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs and wings for each type of animal:

- Chickens: 7 chickens * (2 legs + 2 wings) = 7 * 4 = 28
- Sheep: 5 sheep * 4 legs = 5 * 4 = 20
- Grasshoppers: 10 grasshoppers * (6 legs + 2 wings) = 10 * 8 = 80
- Spiders: 3 spiders * 8 legs = 3 * 8 = 24
- Pigeons: 4 pigeons * (2 legs + 2 wings) = 4 * 4 = 16
- Kangaroos: 2 kangaroos * 2 legs = 2 * 2 = 4

Now, let's add up all the legs and wings:

Total legs and wings = 28 (chickens) + 20 (sheep) + 80 (grasshoppers) + 24 (spiders) + 16 (pigeons) + 4 (kangaroos)
Total legs and wings = 172

Therefore, there were a total of 172 legs and wings among all the animals Farmer Brown fed."
Ethan and Frank went rowing. Ethan rowed the boat at a speed of 3 km/h from 10:50 to 11:15. Frank rowed the boat at a speed of 4 km/h for twice as long as Ethan. What is the total distance they covered together while rowing?,"First, let's calculate the time Ethan spent rowing. He rowed from 10:50 to 11:15, which is a total of 25 minutes.

Now, we need to convert the time Ethan rowed into hours because the speed is given in km/h. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

25 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 0.4167 hours (rounded to four decimal places)

Now, we can calculate the distance Ethan covered by multiplying his speed by the time he rowed.

Distance covered by Ethan = Speed of Ethan × Time Ethan rowed
Distance covered by Ethan = 3 km/h × 0.4167 hours
Distance covered by Ethan = 1.25 km (rounded to two decimal places)

Frank rowed for twice as long as Ethan, so we need to calculate the time Frank spent rowing.

Time Frank rowed = 2 × Time Ethan rowed
Time Frank rowed = 2 × 0.4167 hours
Time Frank rowed = 0.8334 hours (rounded to four decimal places)

Now, we can calculate the distance Frank covered by multiplying his speed by the time he rowed.

Distance covered by Frank = Speed of Frank × Time Frank rowed
Distance covered by Frank = 4 km/h × 0.8334 hours
Distance covered by Frank = 3.3336 km (rounded to four decimal places)

Finally, we can calculate the total distance covered by both Ethan and Frank by adding their individual distances.

Total distance covered = Distance covered by Ethan + Distance covered by Frank
Total distance covered = 1.25 km + 3.3336 km
Total distance covered = 4.5836 km

Rounded to two decimal places, the total distance they covered together while rowing is 4.58 km."
"Hattie and her friend Lorelei are doing a jumping contest using a jumping rope. Hattie does 180 jumps in the first round, while Lorelei jumps 3/4 as many times as Hattie jumped. In the second round, Lorelei does 50 more jumps than Hattie. Hattie managed to jump a certain fraction of the number of jumps she did in the first round. The total number of jumps the two did in the two rounds is 605. What is the ratio of the number of jumps Hattie did in the second round to the number of jumps she did in the first round?","Let's start by calculating the number of jumps Lorelei did in the first round. Since she jumped 3/4 as many times as Hattie, we can calculate this as:

Lorelei's jumps in the first round = 3/4 * Hattie's jumps in the first round
Lorelei's jumps in the first round = 3/4 * 180
Lorelei's jumps in the first round = 135

Now, let's denote the number of jumps Hattie did in the second round as H2. According to the problem, Lorelei did 50 more jumps than Hattie in the second round, so we can express Lorelei's jumps in the second round as:

Lorelei's jumps in the second round = H2 + 50

The total number of jumps the two did in the two rounds is 605, so we can write the equation:

Hattie's jumps in the first round + Lorelei's jumps in the first round + Hattie's jumps in the second round + Lorelei's jumps in the second round = Total jumps
180 + 135 + H2 + (H2 + 50) = 605

Now, let's solve for H2:

315 + 2H2 + 50 = 605
2H2 + 365 = 605
2H2 = 605 - 365
2H2 = 240
H2 = 240 / 2
H2 = 120

So, Hattie did 120 jumps in the second round. Now we can find the ratio of the number of jumps Hattie did in the second round to the number of jumps she did in the first round:

Ratio = Hattie's jumps in the second round / Hattie's jumps in the first round
Ratio = 120 / 180
Ratio = 2 / 3

Therefore, the ratio of the number of jumps Hattie did in the second round to the number of jumps she did in the first round is 2:3."
A plane flies 900 miles with a tail wind in 3 hours. The same plane takes 4 hours to make the return trip against the wind. What is the speed of the plane in still air?,"Let's denote the speed of the plane in still air as \( p \) (in miles per hour) and the speed of the wind as \( w \) (also in miles per hour).

When the plane is flying with the tail wind, its effective speed is \( p + w \), and when it is flying against the wind, its effective speed is \( p - w \).

We are given that the plane flies 900 miles with the tail wind in 3 hours. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (p + w) \times 3 = 900 \]

Similarly, for the return trip against the wind, the plane takes 4 hours to fly the same 900 miles. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (p - w) \times 4 = 900 \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( 3p + 3w = 900 \)
2. \( 4p - 4w = 900 \)

We can simplify both equations by dividing by 3 and 4, respectively:

1. \( p + w = 300 \)
2. \( p - w = 225 \)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for \( p \) and \( w \) by adding the two equations together:

\( (p + w) + (p - w) = 300 + 225 \)

\( 2p = 525 \)

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( p \):

\( p = 525 / 2 \)

\( p = 262.5 \)

So, the speed of the plane in still air is 262.5 miles per hour."
"A person can swim in still water at 12 km/h. If the speed of water is a certain speed, the man takes 6 hours to swim back against the current for 12 km. What is the speed of the water?","Let's denote the speed of the water as \( v \) km/h. When the person swims against the current, their effective speed is reduced by the speed of the water. Therefore, the effective speed of the person swimming against the current is \( (12 - v) \) km/h.

We know that the person takes 6 hours to swim back 12 km against the current. We can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given that the distance is 12 km and the time is 6 hours, we can set up the equation:

\[ 12 = (12 - v) \times 6 \]

Now we can solve for \( v \):

\[ 12 = 72 - 6v \]

Add \( 6v \) to both sides:

\[ 12 + 6v = 72 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 6v = 72 - 12 \]

\[ 6v = 60 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ v = \frac{60}{6} \]

\[ v = 10 \]

So, the speed of the water is 10 km/h."
"To support the school outreach program, Einstein wants to raise $500 in 5 days by selling snacks. One box of pizza sells for $12, a pack of potato fries sells for $0.30, a can of soda at $2, a package of cookies for $3, and a bag of popcorn for $1.50. Einstein's goal is to sell 20 boxes of pizzas, 60 packs of potato fries, 40 cans of soda, 30 packages of cookies, and 50 bags of popcorn within this time frame. After selling 15 boxes of pizzas, 40 packs of potato fries, 25 cans of soda, 20 packages of cookies, and 35 bags of popcorn in the first 3 days, how much more money does Einstein need to raise by the end of the 5th day to reach his goal, and what should be the daily sales target for the remaining 2 days to achieve the goal?","First, let's calculate the total amount of money Einstein has raised in the first 3 days by selling snacks.

15 boxes of pizzas at $12 each: 15 * $12 = $180
40 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: 40 * $0.30 = $12
25 cans of soda at $2 each: 25 * $2 = $50
20 packages of cookies at $3 each: 20 * $3 = $60
35 bags of popcorn at $1.50 each: 35 * $1.50 = $52.50

Total amount raised in the first 3 days: $180 + $12 + $50 + $60 + $52.50 = $354.50

Now, let's calculate how much more money Einstein needs to raise to reach the $500 goal.

$500 (goal) - $354.50 (amount raised) = $145.50

Einstein needs to raise an additional $145.50 in the remaining 2 days.

To find the daily sales target for the remaining 2 days, we divide the amount needed by the number of days left.

$145.50 / 2 days = $72.75

Einstein should aim to raise $72.75 each day for the remaining 2 days to reach the goal of $500."
"Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples (x) in each bag, 6 bags with 25 apples (y) in each bag, 3 bags with 15 oranges (w) and 5 bags with 30 oranges (v). She sells apples for $0.50 (a) each and oranges for $0.75 (b) each. If Ella sells 200 apples (z) and 75 oranges (t), how much total revenue does Ella earn from selling the fruits?","First, let's calculate the revenue from selling apples. Ella sells 200 apples at $0.50 each.

Revenue from apples = Number of apples sold (z) * Price per apple (a)
Revenue from apples = z * a
Revenue from apples = 200 * $0.50
Revenue from apples = $100

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling oranges. Ella sells 75 oranges at $0.75 each.

Revenue from oranges = Number of oranges sold (t) * Price per orange (b)
Revenue from oranges = t * b
Revenue from oranges = 75 * $0.75
Revenue from oranges = $56.25

Now, let's add the revenue from apples and oranges to get the total revenue.

Total revenue = Revenue from apples + Revenue from oranges
Total revenue = $100 + $56.25
Total revenue = $156.25

Ella earns a total revenue of $156.25 from selling the fruits."
Peter invests a sum of money and gets back an amount of $815 in 3 years. David invests an equal amount of money and gets an amount in 4 years. Both amounts were invested at the same rate (simple interest). The sum of money invested was $698. What was the amount David got back after 4 years?,"Let's denote the principal amount (the sum of money invested) as P, the rate of interest as r, and the time as t. The formula for calculating the amount (A) received from an investment at simple interest is:

A = P + (P * r * t)

Given that Peter invests P = $698 and gets back A = $815 in t = 3 years, we can use the formula to find the rate of interest (r). Let's first find the interest (I) Peter earned:

I = A - P
I = $815 - $698
I = $117

Now, we can use the interest to find the rate:

I = P * r * t
$117 = $698 * r * 3

Now, solve for r:

r = $117 / ($698 * 3)
r = $117 / $2094
r = 0.05582 (rounded to five decimal places)

Now that we have the rate, we can find the amount David got back after 4 years. Since David invested the same amount P = $698 for t = 4 years at the same rate r, we can calculate the amount A for David:

A = P + (P * r * t)
A = $698 + ($698 * 0.05582 * 4)

Now, calculate the amount:

A = $698 + ($698 * 0.22328)
A = $698 + $155.83 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the amount David got back after 4 years is:

A = $698 + $155.83
A = $853.83

David got back $853.83 after 4 years."
"Jack and Christina are standing 240 feet apart on a level surface. Their dog, Lindy, is standing next to Christina. At the same time, they all begin moving toward each other. Jack walks in a straight line toward Christina at a certain speed and Christina walks in a straight line toward Jack at the same speed. Lindy runs at a constant speed of 10 feet per second from Christina to Jack, back to Christina, back to Jack, and so forth. The total distance, in feet, that Lindy has traveled when the three meet at one place is 400 feet. What is the constant speed, in feet per second, at which Jack and Christina walk towards each other?","Let's denote the speed at which Jack and Christina walk as \( v \) feet per second. Since they walk towards each other, their relative speed is \( 2v \) feet per second. 

Lindy runs back and forth between Jack and Christina at a speed of 10 feet per second. The total distance Lindy covers is 400 feet. 

When Jack, Christina, and Lindy meet at one place, the distance between Jack and Christina has been covered. This distance is 240 feet. Since Jack and Christina are moving towards each other at a relative speed of \( 2v \), the time it takes for them to meet is the distance divided by their relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{2v \text{ feet/second}} = \frac{120}{v} \text{ seconds} \]

During this time, Lindy has been running back and forth at a speed of 10 feet per second. The distance Lindy covers is the product of Lindy's speed and the time:

\[ \text{Distance}_\text{Lindy} = \text{Speed}_\text{Lindy} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ feet/second} \times \frac{120}{v} \text{ seconds} \]

We know that the distance Lindy covers is 400 feet:

\[ 10 \times \frac{120}{v} = 400 \]

Solving for \( v \):

\[ \frac{1200}{v} = 400 \]

\[ v = \frac{1200}{400} \]

\[ v = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

So, the constant speed at which Jack and Christina walk towards each other is 3 feet per second."
"There are 14 players in a chess group, and each player plays each of the others once. Given that each game is played by two players, how many total games will be played?","To find the total number of games played, we can use the formula for combinations since each game is a unique combination of two players from the group. The formula for combinations is:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

where n is the total number of items (in this case, players), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 for a game of chess), and ""!"" denotes factorial.

For this problem, n = 14 (since there are 14 players) and k = 2 (since each game is played by 2 players).

So the total number of games, C(14, 2), is calculated as:

C(14, 2) = 14! / (2! * (14 - 2)!)
C(14, 2) = 14! / (2! * 12!)
C(14, 2) = (14 * 13 * 12!) / (2 * 1 * 12!)
C(14, 2) = (14 * 13) / (2 * 1)
C(14, 2) = 182 / 2
C(14, 2) = 91

Therefore, a total of 91 games will be played."
"in what time will a train 140 m long cross an electric pole , it its speed be 108 km / hr ?","To find the time it takes for the train to cross an electric pole, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s), and then use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to m/s:

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s)

Speed in m/s = 108 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s)
Speed in m/s = 108 * 1000 / 3600
Speed in m/s = 108000 / 3600
Speed in m/s = 30 m/s

Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the electric pole:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 140 m / 30 m/s
Time = 4.67 seconds

So, it will take approximately 4.67 seconds for the train to cross the electric pole."
A perfect score is 21 points. How many points would you have after 3 perfect games in a row?,"If a perfect score is 21 points and you have 3 perfect games in a row, you would have:

"a person was asked to state his age in years . his reply was , ` ` take my age 5 years hence , multiply it by 3 and subtract 3 times my age 5 years ago and you will know how old i am . ' ' what was the age of the person ?","Let's call the person's current age ""x"" years.

According to the person's reply, we need to take his age 5 years from now, which would be (x + 5) years, multiply it by 3 to get 3(x + 5), and then subtract 3 times his age 5 years ago, which would be 3(x - 5).

So the equation based on his reply would be:

3(x + 5) - 3(x - 5) = x

Now, let's solve for x:

3x + 15 - 3x + 15 = x
3x + 15 - 3x = x - 15
3x - 3x = x - 15 - 15
0 = x - 30

Therefore, x = 30

The person's current age is 30 years."

"Each year for 4 years, a farmer increased the number of trees in a certain orchard by 1/4 of the number of trees in the orchard of the preceding year. If all of the trees thrived and there were 2304 trees in the orchard at the beginning of the 4-year period, how many trees were in the orchard at the end of the 4-year period?","Let's denote the number of trees at the beginning of the 4-year period as T_0. According to the problem, T_0 = 2304.

Each year, the number of trees increases by 1/4 of the number of trees from the preceding year. So, if T_n represents the number of trees at the end of year n, then:

T_1 = T_0 + (1/4) * T_0
T_2 = T_1 + (1/4) * T_1
T_3 = T_2 + (1/4) * T_2
T_4 = T_3 + (1/4) * T_3

We can calculate the number of trees at the end of each year:

T_1 = 2304 + (1/4) * 2304
T_1 = 2304 + 576
T_1 = 2880

T_2 = 2880 + (1/4) * 2880
T_2 = 2880 + 720
T_2 = 3600

T_3 = 3600 + (1/4) * 3600
T_3 = 3600 + 900
T_3 = 4500

T_4 = 4500 + (1/4) * 4500
T_4 = 4500 + 1125
T_4 = 5625

So, at the end of the 4-year period, there were 5625 trees in the orchard."
"What is the greatest possible length that can be used to measure exactly 12 meters 34 cm, a certain length, and 6 meters 65 cm if the greatest common divisor of all three lengths is 1 cm? What is the second length?","To find the greatest possible length that can be used to measure the given lengths exactly, we need to convert all lengths to the same unit, which is centimeters in this case. 

First, we convert the lengths to centimeters:
- 12 meters 34 cm = 12 * 100 cm + 34 cm = 1234 cm
- 6 meters 65 cm = 6 * 100 cm + 65 cm = 665 cm

We are told that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all three lengths is 1 cm. This means that the lengths are relatively prime to each other, and the greatest possible length that can measure them exactly is 1 cm.

Now, we need to find the second length. Let's call it L cm. Since the GCD of 1234 cm, L cm, and 665 cm is 1 cm, L must also be relatively prime to both 1234 and 665.

Since we don't have a specific value for L, we can't determine the exact length. However, we know that L must be a length in centimeters that is not divisible by any prime factors of 1234 and 665.

To find the prime factors of 1234 and 665, we can perform prime factorization:
- 1234 = 2 * 617 (617 is a prime number)
- 665 = 5 * 7 * 19

Since the GCD of all three lengths is 1 cm, L must not have any common prime factors with 1234 and 665. Therefore, L can be any length in centimeters that is not divisible by 2, 5, 7, 19, or 617.

Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact value of L, but we know that it must be a positive integer that is relatively prime to 1234 and 665."
"right now , the ratio between the ages of sandy and molly is 4 : 3 . after 6 years , sandy ’ s age will be 42 years . what is molly ' s age right now ?","Let's denote Sandy's current age as S and Molly's current age as M.

According to the given information, the ratio of their ages is 4:3, so we can write the following equation:

S / M = 4 / 3

We also know that after 6 years, Sandy's age will be 42 years. Therefore, we can express Sandy's current age as:

S + 6 = 42

Now we can solve for S:

S = 42 - 6
S = 36

Now that we know Sandy's current age, we can use the ratio to find Molly's current age. We can rewrite the ratio equation as:

4M = 3S

Substitute the value of S we found:

4M = 3 * 36
4M = 108

Now, solve for M:

M = 108 / 4
M = 27

So, Molly's current age is 27 years."
What is some fraction of 5 / 7 of 2 / 3 that results in 0.2857142857142857?,"To find a fraction of \( \frac{5}{7} \) of \( \frac{2}{3} \) that results in 0.2857142857142857, we first need to calculate \( \frac{5}{7} \) of \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\( \frac{5}{7} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5 \times 2}{7 \times 3} = \frac{10}{21} \)

Now, we need to find a fraction of \( \frac{10}{21} \) that equals 0.2857142857142857. To do this, we can set up the equation:

\( \frac{10}{21} \times x = 0.2857142857142857 \)

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( \frac{10}{21} \):

\( x = \frac{0.2857142857142857}{\frac{10}{21}} \)

\( x = 0.2857142857142857 \times \frac{21}{10} \)

\( x = 0.2857142857142857 \times 2.1 \)

\( x = 0.6 \)

So, \( \frac{3}{5} \) (or 60%) of \( \frac{10}{21} \) results in 0.2857142857142857."
50 is 40% of a certain number. What is that number?,"To find the number, we can set up the following equation:

50 = 40% * x

where x is the number we're trying to find.

First, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

50 = 0.4 * x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 50 / 0.4
x = 125

So, the number that 50 is 40% of is 125."
There is a rectangular prism made of 1 in cubes that has been covered in tin foil. There are some cubes that are not touching any tin foil on any of their sides. The width of the figure created by these cubes is twice the length and twice the height. The measure of the width of the foil-covered prism is 10 inches. How many cubes are not touching any tin foil on any of their sides?,"Let's denote the length of the figure created by the cubes not touching any tin foil as \( l \), the width as \( w \), and the height as \( h \). According to the problem, the width of the figure is twice the length and twice the height, so we have:

\( w = 2l \) and \( w = 2h \).

Since the width of the foil-covered prism is 10 inches, the width of the figure created by the cubes not touching any tin foil must be 10 inches minus 2 inches from each side (because the cubes on the edges are covered by foil), so:

\( w = 10 - 2 - 2 \)
\( w = 6 \) inches.

Now, using the relationships \( w = 2l \) and \( w = 2h \), we can find the length and height:

\( l = w / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 \) inches,
\( h = w / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 \) inches.

The number of cubes not touching any tin foil on any of their sides is the volume of the figure created by these cubes, which is:

\( l \times w \times h = 3 \times 6 \times 3 \).

So the number of cubes is:

\( 3 \times 6 \times 3 = 54 \) cubes.

Therefore, there are 54 cubes not touching any tin foil on any of their sides."
Herman likes to feed the birds in some months. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon. He will need 90 cups of food for all those months. How many months does Herman feed the birds?,"Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon, which totals 1 cup per day.

If he needs 90 cups of food for all those months, we need to find out how many days he feeds the birds and then convert that into months.

Since 1 day of feeding requires 1 cup, for 90 cups, he will feed the birds for 90 days.

Now, we need to convert the days into months. Typically, a month is considered to have about 30 days (although this can vary from 28 to 31 days depending on the month).

So, we divide the total number of days by the average number of days in a month:

90 days ÷ 30 days/month = 3 months

Herman feeds the birds for 3 months."
"Chris has twelve marbles, and Ryan has twenty-eight marbles. If they put marbles together in a pile and then each takes away 1/4 of marbles from the pile, calculate the number of marbles remaining in the pile.","First, let's find out how many marbles they have in total when they put them together in a pile.

Chris's marbles: 12
Ryan's marbles: 28

Total marbles in the pile: 12 + 28 = 40 marbles

Now, they each take away 1/4 of the marbles from the pile. Since there are two of them, they will take away 1/4 of the pile twice.

1/4 of the pile: 40 marbles * 1/4 = 10 marbles

Since both Chris and Ryan take away 1/4 of the pile, the total amount taken away is:
10 marbles (by Chris) + 10 marbles (by Ryan) = 20 marbles

Now, let's subtract the total amount taken away from the original pile to find the number of marbles remaining.

Remaining marbles in the pile: 40 marbles - 20 marbles = 20 marbles

So, after Chris and Ryan each take away 1/4 of the marbles from the pile, there will be 20 marbles remaining in the pile."
"There were 44 laptops in the shop, and Mike divided them equally into some rows. There were 4 laptops left. How many rows did Mike create?","To find out how many rows Mike created, we need to subtract the 4 laptops that were left from the total number of laptops and then divide the remaining number of laptops by the number of laptops in each row.

There were 44 laptops in total, and 4 were left, so we have:

44 - 4 = 40 laptops to be divided into rows.

Since the laptops were divided equally into rows, we need to find a number that 40 can be divided by without leaving any remainder. 

The number of laptops in each row would be a factor of 40. The factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40. Since we're looking for the number of rows, we can exclude 1 and 40 because that would mean either 1 row of 40 laptops or 40 rows of 1 laptop, neither of which would leave 4 laptops remaining.

Let's try dividing 40 by the other factors:

- 40 ÷ 2 = 20 rows (but this would mean 2 laptops per row, which doesn't leave 4 laptops remaining)
- 40 ÷ 4 = 10 rows (this would mean 4 laptops per row, which is a possible solution)
- 40 ÷ 5 = 8 rows (but this would mean 5 laptops per row, which doesn't leave 4 laptops remaining)
- 40 ÷ 8 = 5 rows (but this would mean 8 laptops per row, which doesn't leave 4 laptops remaining)
- 40 ÷ 10 = 4 rows (but this would mean 10 laptops per row, which doesn't leave 4 laptops remaining)
- 40 ÷ 20 = 2 rows (but this would mean 20 laptops per row, which doesn't leave 4 laptops remaining)

The only factor that makes sense in this context is 4, which would mean Mike created 10 rows of 4 laptops each, with 4 laptops left over. 

So, Mike created 10 rows."
"Two trains 150 meters and 165 meters in length respectively are running in opposite directions, one at the rate of 80 km and the other at the rate of 65 kmph. In what time will they be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet?","To find out how long it will take for the two trains to be completely clear of each other, we need to calculate the relative speed at which they are moving apart and then determine how long it will take for them to cover a distance equal to the sum of their lengths.

The length of the first train is 150 meters, and the length of the second train is 165 meters. So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is:

Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2
Total distance = 150 meters + 165 meters
Total distance = 315 meters

The speed of the first train is 80 km/h, and the speed of the second train is 65 km/h. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed:

Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2
Relative speed = 80 km/h + 65 km/h
Relative speed = 145 km/h

To work with consistent units, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to meters per second (m/s). We use the conversion factor that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 meters/3600 seconds (or 5/18 m/s):

Relative speed in m/s = Relative speed in km/h × (1000 m / 3600 s)
Relative speed in m/s = 145 × (5/18)
Relative speed in m/s = 145 × 5 / 18
Relative speed in m/s = 725 / 18
Relative speed in m/s = 40.277... m/s (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other:

Time = Total distance / Relative speed
Time = 315 meters / 40.277... m/s
Time ≈ 7.82 seconds

Therefore, it will take approximately 7.82 seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."
"The present age of the father is 4 years more than 4 times the age of his son. In a few years, the father's age will be some years more than twice the age of the son. The present age of the father is 44. How many years more will the father's age be than twice the age of the son in that future time?","Let's denote the present age of the son as S years. According to the information given, the present age of the father is 4 years more than 4 times the age of his son. So we can write the equation for the father's age (F) as:

F = 4S + 4

We are given that the present age of the father is 44 years. So we can substitute F with 44 in the equation:

44 = 4S + 4

Now, let's solve for S:

44 - 4 = 4S
40 = 4S
S = 40 / 4
S = 10

So, the present age of the son is 10 years.

Now, let's denote the number of years in the future as Y years. In Y years, the son's age will be S + Y and the father's age will be F + Y. We are told that in a few years, the father's age will be some years more than twice the age of the son. Let's denote this difference as D years. So we can write the equation:

F + Y = 2(S + Y) + D

We know F = 44 and S = 10, so let's substitute these values into the equation:

44 + Y = 2(10 + Y) + D

Now, let's solve for D:

44 + Y = 20 + 2Y + D
44 - 20 = 2Y - Y + D
24 = Y + D

Since we are looking for the value of D (how many years more the father's age will be than twice the age of the son), we need to express D in terms of Y:

D = 24 - Y

Without the specific value of Y (the number of years in the future), we cannot determine the exact value of D. However, we have expressed D in terms of Y, which shows the relationship between the number of years in the future and the difference in age. If we had the value of Y, we could calculate D directly."

First, let's find out what 30% of 150 is:

30% of 150 = (30/100) * 150
             = 0.30 * 150

"Jack and Christina are standing 360 feet apart on a level surface. Their dog, Lindy, is standing next to Christina. At the same time, they all begin moving toward each other. Jack walks in a straight line toward Christina at a constant speed of 5 feet per second and Christina walks in a straight line toward Jack at a constant speed of 7 feet per second. Lindy runs at a certain speed from Christina to Jack, back to Christina, back to Jack, and so forth. The total distance, in feet, that Lindy has traveled when the three meet at one place is 360 feet. What is Lindy's speed in feet per second?","Let's denote Lindy's speed as \( v \) feet per second.

First, we need to find out how long it takes for Jack and Christina to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is \( 5 + 7 = 12 \) feet per second.

The distance between them is 360 feet, so the time it takes for them to meet is \( \frac{360}{12} = 30 \) seconds.

During this time, Lindy is running back and forth between Jack and Christina. Since Lindy meets them at the same point, the total distance Lindy runs is 360 feet, which is given in the problem.

Now we can calculate Lindy's speed using the total distance Lindy runs and the time it takes for Jack and Christina to meet:

\( v = \frac{\text{Total distance Lindy runs}}{\text{Time}} \)

\( v = \frac{360}{30} \)

\( v = 12 \) feet per second.

So, Lindy's speed is 12 feet per second."
Two trains of equal length are running on parallel lines in the same direction at 46 km/hr and 36 km/hr. The faster train catches and completely passes the slower train in 45 seconds. What is the length of each train in meters?,"Let's denote the length of each train as L meters.

Since the trains are of equal length and the faster train is overtaking the slower one, we can calculate the relative speed at which the faster train is catching up to the slower train. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds because they are moving in the same direction.

Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train
Relative speed = 46 km/hr - 36 km/hr
Relative speed = 10 km/hr

To work with meters and seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km/hr is equivalent to 1000 m / 3600 s.

Relative speed in m/s = 10 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s)
Relative speed in m/s = (10 * 1000) / 3600
Relative speed in m/s = 10000 / 3600
Relative speed in m/s = 2.777... m/s (approximately)

Now, we know that the faster train takes 45 seconds to completely pass the slower train. This means that in 45 seconds, the faster train covers the distance equal to the length of both trains (since they are of equal length).

Distance covered in 45 seconds = Relative speed * Time
Distance covered in 45 seconds = 2.777... m/s * 45 s
Distance covered in 45 seconds = 125 m (approximately)

Since the distance covered is the combined length of both trains and both trains are of equal length, we can say:

2L = 125 m
L = 125 m / 2
L = 62.5 m

Therefore, the length of each train is approximately 62.5 meters."
"The ferris wheel in paradise park has 6.0 seats. A certain number of people want to ride the ferris wheel, and it has to run 2.333333333 times for everyone to get a turn. How many people want to ride the ferris wheel?","If the ferris wheel has 6.0 seats and it has to run 2.333333333 times for everyone to get a turn, we can calculate the total number of people who want to ride the ferris wheel by multiplying the number of seats by the number of times the ferris wheel has to run.

Total number of people = Number of seats × Number of runs
Total number of people = 6.0 × 2.333333333

To get the exact number of people, we multiply 6.0 by 2.333333333:

Total number of people = 14 (rounded to the nearest whole number, since you can't have a fraction of a person)

So, 14 people want to ride the ferris wheel."
"Right now, Al and Eliot have bank accounts, and Al has more money than Eliot. The difference between their two accounts is a certain fraction of the sum of their two accounts. If Al's account were to increase by 10% and Eliot's account were to increase by 15%, then Al would have exactly $22 more than Eliot in his account. Eliot has $146.67 in his account right now. What is the fraction representing the difference between their two accounts?","Let's denote Al's current amount as \( A \) and Eliot's current amount as \( E \). We are given that \( E = $146.67 \).

We are told that the difference between their accounts is a certain fraction of the sum of their accounts. Let's call this fraction \( f \). So we have:

\[ A - E = f(A + E) \]

We are also told that if Al's account were to increase by 10% and Eliot's account were to increase by 15%, then Al would have exactly $22 more than Eliot. This gives us a second equation:

\[ 1.10A = 1.15E + $22 \]

Now we can solve these equations to find \( A \) and \( f \).

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( E \):

\[ 1.10A = 1.15E + $22 \]
\[ A = \frac{1.15E + $22}{1.10} \]
\[ A = 1.04545E + $20 \]

Now we know \( E = $146.67 \), so we can substitute this value into the equation to find \( A \):

\[ A = 1.04545 \times $146.67 + $20 \]
\[ A = $153.33 + $20 \]
\[ A = $173.33 \]

Now we have both \( A \) and \( E \), we can find the fraction \( f \):

\[ A - E = f(A + E) \]
\[ $173.33 - $146.67 = f($173.33 + $146.67) \]
\[ $26.66 = f($320) \]

Now we solve for \( f \):

\[ f = \frac{$26.66}{$320} \]
\[ f = 0.0833125 \]

So the fraction representing the difference between their two accounts is approximately \( 0.0833 \) or \( \frac{1}{12} \) when rounded to four decimal places."
"The pet store can buy a goldfish for $.50 and sell it for $1.50. The owner plans to use the profits from goldfish sales to buy a new deluxe tank, which costs $200. Each day, the store incurs an additional $5 in expenses for maintaining the goldfish. After one week, he is 55% short of the price of the deluxe tank. How many goldfish did he sell that week?","Let's first calculate the total amount the owner has after one week. If he is 55% short of the price of the deluxe tank, which costs $200, then he has 45% of the price.

45% of $200 = 0.45 * $200 = $90

This $90 is the profit after deducting the daily expenses for maintaining the goldfish. Since the daily expenses are $5, for one week (7 days) the total expenses would be:

$5/day * 7 days = $35

So, the total amount he made from selling goldfish before expenses is:

$90 (profit) + $35 (expenses) = $125

Now, let's calculate the profit per goldfish. If he buys a goldfish for $0.50 and sells it for $1.50, the profit per goldfish is:

$1.50 - $0.50 = $1.00

To find out how many goldfish he sold, we divide the total amount made from selling goldfish by the profit per goldfish:

$125 / $1.00/goldfish = 125 goldfish

Therefore, the owner sold 125 goldfish that week."
"Abby is building 2 raised beds to grow vegetables.  The beds are both 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 1 foot high.  Each bag of soil has 4 cubic feet.  How many bags of soil will she need?","First, we need to calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is calculated by multiplying the length by the width by the height.

For one raised bed:
Volume = Length × Width × Height
Volume = 8 feet × 4 feet × 1 foot
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Abby is building 2 raised beds, we need to double the volume calculated for one bed:
Total volume for 2 beds = 32 cubic feet × 2
Total volume for 2 beds = 64 cubic feet

Now, we know that each bag of soil contains 4 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Abby will need, we divide the total volume of soil needed by the volume of soil in one bag:

Number of bags needed = Total volume for 2 beds ÷ Volume per bag
Number of bags needed = 64 cubic feet ÷ 4 cubic feet per bag
Number of bags needed = 16 bags

Abby will need 16 bags of soil to fill both raised beds."
"Dan's car gets 32 miles per gallon. If gas costs $4/gallon, then how many miles can Dan's car go on a certain amount of gas? The car can go 432 miles on that amount of gas.","To find out how many gallons of gas Dan's car used to go 432 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by the miles per gallon (mpg) the car gets:

432 miles ÷ 32 miles/gallon = 13.5 gallons

So, Dan's car used 13.5 gallons of gas to go 432 miles. If gas costs $4 per gallon, we can calculate the cost of the 13.5 gallons of gas:

13.5 gallons × $4/gallon = $54

Therefore, it cost Dan $54 to go 432 miles."
"Two siblings, Eman and Frank, agreed to buy a new computer table, computer chair, joystick, and gaming headset. The computer table costs $140, the computer chair costs $100, the joystick costs $20, and the gaming headset costs $60. Eman agreed to pay for the computer chair while Frank agreed to pay for the computer table. Then Frank agreed to pay 1/3 of the price of both the joystick and the gaming headset, and the rest will be paid by Eman. How much more money will Frank spend than Eman?","First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

Computer table: $140
Computer chair: $100
Joystick: $20
Gaming headset: $60

Now, let's see how much Frank and Eman will pay for the joystick and the gaming headset:

Frank's share for the joystick: 1/3 of $20 = $20 / 3 = $6.67 (approximately)
Frank's share for the gaming headset: 1/3 of $60 = $60 / 3 = $20

Eman's share for the joystick: 2/3 of $20 = $20 - $6.67 = $13.33 (approximately)
Eman's share for the gaming headset: 2/3 of $60 = $60 - $20 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total amount each person will pay:

Frank's total payment:
Computer table: $140
Joystick (1/3): $6.67
Gaming headset (1/3): $20
Total for Frank = $140 + $6.67 + $20 = $166.67

Eman's total payment:
Computer chair: $100
Joystick (2/3): $13.33
Gaming headset (2/3): $40
Total for Eman = $100 + $13.33 + $40 = $153.33

Finally, let's find out how much more money Frank will spend than Eman:

Difference = Frank's total payment - Eman's total payment
Difference = $166.67 - $153.33 = $13.34

Frank will spend $13.34 more than Eman."
"if ( 1 / 2 ) ^ 16 ( 1 / 81 ) ^ k = 1 / 18 ^ 16 , then k =","To solve for k, we need to simplify the given equation:

(1/2)^16 * (1/81)^k = 1/(18^16)

First, let's simplify the right side of the equation:

18^16 = (2 * 9)^16 = (2^16 * 9^16) = (2^16 * (3^2)^16) = 2^16 * 3^(2*16) = 2^16 * 3^32

Now, the equation becomes:

(1/2)^16 * (1/81)^k = 1/(2^16 * 3^32)

Since 81 is 3^4, we can rewrite (1/81)^k as (1/(3^4))^k = (3^-4)^k = 3^(-4k)

Now, the equation is:

(1/2)^16 * 3^(-4k) = 1/(2^16 * 3^32)

We can now equate the exponents of the corresponding bases on both sides of the equation:

For the base 2:
(1/2)^16 = 1/(2^16)
This is already equal on both sides, so we don't need to do anything further with the base 2.

For the base 3:
3^(-4k) = 1/(3^32)

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:

-4k = -32

Now, we can solve for k:

k = -32 / -4
k = 8

Therefore, k = 8."
"Nala found 5 seashells at the beach on Monday. On Tuesday, she found another 7 seashells and discarded 3 because they were broken. On Wednesday, she found twice the number of seashells she gathered on Monday, and discarded half of them as they were broken as well. On Thursday, Nala found 3 times the number of seashells she found on Tuesday. If she only keeps the unbroken seashells, how many seashells does Nala have by the end of Thursday?","Let's calculate the number of unbroken seashells Nala has each day:

Monday:
She found 5 seashells and none were discarded, so she keeps all 5.

Tuesday:
She found 7 seashells and discarded 3, so she keeps 7 - 3 = 4 seashells.

Wednesday:
She found twice the number she found on Monday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 seashells. She discarded half of them, so she keeps half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 seashells.

Thursday:
She found 3 times the number she found on Tuesday, which is 3 * 7 = 21 seashells. Since there's no mention of discarding any on Thursday, she keeps all 21.

Now, let's add up the seashells she kept each day:
Monday: 5
Tuesday: 4
Wednesday: 5
Thursday: 21

Total seashells = 5 + 4 + 5 + 21 = 35 seashells.

Nala has 35 unbroken seashells by the end of Thursday."
Two trains 120 m and 160 m long run at the speed of 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr respectively in opposite directions on parallel tracks. How long do they take to cross each other?,"To find out how long the two trains take to cross each other, we need to calculate the relative speed at which they are moving towards each other and then determine the time it takes for them to cover the combined length of both trains.

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.

Speed of first train = 60 km/hr
Speed of second train = 40 km/hr

Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train
Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr
Relative speed = 100 km/hr

Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the lengths of the trains which are given in meters.

1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr)
1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s
1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s

Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is:
Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr)
Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s
Relative speed = (500/18) m/s
Relative speed ≈ 27.78 m/s

The combined length of the two trains is:
Combined length = Length of first train + Length of second train
Combined length = 120 m + 160 m
Combined length = 280 m

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other using the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

Time = Combined length / Relative speed
Time = 280 m / 27.78 m/s
Time ≈ 10.08 seconds

Therefore, it takes approximately 10.08 seconds for the two trains to cross each other."
"Last year, the school library purchased some new books. This year, it purchased 3 times as many books as last year. The library had 100 books before it purchased new books last year, and now there are 300 books in the library. How many books did the library purchase last year?","Let's denote the number of books purchased last year as X.

This year, the library purchased 3 times as many books as last year, so this year they purchased 3X books.

Before any new books were purchased last year, the library had 100 books. After purchasing books last year and this year, the library now has 300 books.

So the equation representing the total number of books after both years of purchases is:

100 (initial books) + X (last year's purchase) + 3X (this year's purchase) = 300 (total books now)

Combining like terms, we get:

100 + 4X = 300

Now, we'll solve for X:

4X = 300 - 100
4X = 200

Divide both sides by 4 to find X:

X = 200 / 4
X = 50

So, the library purchased 50 books last year."
how many seconds will a train 140 meters long take to cross a bridge 150 meters long if the speed of the train is 36 kmph ?,"First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) because the lengths are given in meters.

The conversion factor is:
1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds

So, 36 kmph = 36 * (1000 / 3600) m/s
36 kmph = 10 m/s

Now, we need to calculate the total distance the train needs to cover to completely cross the bridge. This is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge.

Total distance = Length of train + Length of bridge
Total distance = 140 meters + 150 meters
Total distance = 290 meters

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 290 meters / 10 m/s
Time = 29 seconds

So, it will take the train 29 seconds to cross the bridge."
Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games. Josiah ran for some yards in each of 4 games. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games. The 3 athletes ran a total of 204 yards. How many yards did Josiah run in each game?,"First, let's calculate the total yards Malik rushed for in the 4 games:

Malik's total yards = 18 yards/game * 4 games = 72 yards

Next, let's calculate the total yards Darnell rushed for in the 4 games:

Darnell's total yards = 11 yards/game * 4 games = 44 yards

Now, let's calculate the total yards Malik and Darnell rushed together:

Total yards (Malik + Darnell) = Malik's total yards + Darnell's total yards
Total yards (Malik + Darnell) = 72 yards + 44 yards = 116 yards

Since the three athletes ran a total of 204 yards, we can find out the total yards Josiah ran by subtracting the total yards of Malik and Darnell from the total yards of all three athletes:

Total yards Josiah ran = Total yards (all three athletes) - Total yards (Malik + Darnell)
Total yards Josiah ran = 204 yards - 116 yards = 88 yards

Now, to find out how many yards Josiah ran in each game, we divide the total yards he ran by the number of games:

Yards Josiah ran per game = Total yards Josiah ran / Number of games
Yards Josiah ran per game = 88 yards / 4 games = 22 yards/game

So, Josiah ran 22 yards in each game."
a trader sells 75 meters of cloth for rs . 4950 at the profit of rs . 15 per metre of cloth . what is the cost price of one metre of cloth ?,"To find the cost price of one meter of cloth, we first need to determine the total profit made by the trader on the 75 meters of cloth.

Total profit = Profit per meter × Number of meters
Total profit = Rs. 15 × 75
Total profit = Rs. 1125

Now, we know the selling price of the 75 meters of cloth, which is Rs. 4950. To find the total cost price, we subtract the total profit from the selling price.

Total cost price = Selling price - Total profit
Total cost price = Rs. 4950 - Rs. 1125
Total cost price = Rs. 3825

Now, to find the cost price of one meter of cloth, we divide the total cost price by the number of meters.

Cost price per meter = Total cost price / Number of meters
Cost price per meter = Rs. 3825 / 75
Cost price per meter = Rs. 51

Therefore, the cost price of one meter of cloth is Rs. 51."
"There are 30 major league baseball stadiums. Zach has a goal to take his son to see at least one game at each one. He has calculated the average cost for them to travel and see a game will be $900 per stadium. Zach can save $1,500 per year for his baseball stadium trips. How many years will it take Zach to accomplish his goal?","To calculate the total cost for Zach to take his son to see a game at each of the 30 major league baseball stadiums, we multiply the number of stadiums by the average cost per stadium:

30 stadiums * $900/stadium = $27,000

Now, we know Zach can save $1,500 per year for these trips. To find out how many years it will take him to save enough money to cover the total cost, we divide the total cost by the amount he can save per year:

$27,000 / $1,500/year = 18 years

Therefore, it will take Zach 18 years to save enough money to accomplish his goal of taking his son to see a game at each of the 30 major league baseball stadiums."
"A tree is some height and casts an 8 m long shadow. At the same time, a flag pole casts a 100 m long shadow. The flag pole is 150 m long. How tall is the tree?","To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The tree and its shadow form a right-angled triangle, as do the flagpole and its shadow. Since the sun's rays are at the same angle for both the tree and the flagpole, the ratios of their heights to their shadow lengths will be the same.

Let's denote the height of the tree as \( h \) (in meters). We can set up a proportion using the corresponding sides of the two triangles:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of tree}}{\text{Shadow of tree}} = \frac{\text{Height of flagpole}}{\text{Shadow of flagpole}}
\]

Substituting the given values, we get:

\[
\frac{h}{8} = \frac{150}{100}
\]

Now we can solve for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{150 \times 8}{100}
\]

\[
h = \frac{150}{100} \times 8
\]

\[
h = \frac{3}{2} \times 8
\]

\[
h = 1.5 \times 8
\]

\[
h = 12
\]

So, the tree is 12 meters tall."
"The sum of two numbers X and Y is 578. When dividing X by Y, the quotient is Q and the remainder is 43. Find the divisor Y and quotient Q.","Let's denote the two numbers as X and Y, with X being the larger number since it leaves a remainder when divided by Y.

From the given information, we have two equations:

1) X + Y = 578
2) X = QY + 43

We need to find Y and Q.

From equation 2, we can express X in terms of Y and Q:

X = QY + 43

Now, we substitute this expression for X into equation 1:

(QY + 43) + Y = 578

Combining like terms, we get:

QY + Y = 578 - 43
QY + Y = 535

Factoring out Y, we get:

Y(Q + 1) = 535

Now, we need to find a pair of factors of 535 that differ by 1 when added or subtracted because Q and Y are integers and Q is the quotient when X is divided by Y. The factors of 535 are 1, 5, 107, and 535. The pair that differs by 1 is 107 and 5 because 107 + 1 = 108 and 535 divided by 5 is 107.

So, we can deduce that:

Y = 5
Q = 107

To confirm, we can check if these values satisfy both original equations:

1) X + Y = 578
X + 5 = 578
X = 578 - 5
X = 573

2) X = QY + 43
573 = 107 * 5 + 43
573 = 535 + 43
573 = 573

Both equations are satisfied, so the divisor Y is 5 and the quotient Q is 107."

A crate can hold 20 kilograms of tomatoes. Tommy has 3 crates which he bought for $330. He wants to sell the tomatoes for $6 per 1 kilogram but 3 kilograms of tomatoes were rotten. How much will be Tommy's profit from selling those tomatoes?,"First, let's calculate the total weight of the tomatoes Tommy has:

He has 3 crates, each can hold 20 kilograms, so:
3 crates * 20 kg/crate = 60 kg of tomatoes

However, 3 kilograms of the tomatoes were rotten, so he can't sell those:
60 kg - 3 kg = 57 kg of sellable tomatoes

Tommy wants to sell the tomatoes for $6 per kilogram, so the total revenue from selling the tomatoes will be:
57 kg * $6/kg = $342

Tommy bought the crates for $330, so to find his profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
$342 (revenue) - $330 (cost) = $12 profit

Tommy's profit from selling the tomatoes will be $12."
"A video game map has 5 levels, each with a different shape. The first level is a rectangle that is 40 meters wide and 20 meters long. The second level is a square with a side length of 15 meters. The third level is a right-angled triangle with a base of 25 meters and a height of 12 meters. The fourth level is a trapezoid with an upper base of 10 meters, a lower base of 20 meters, and a height of 8 meters. The fifth level is an irregular shape that can be broken down into a rectangle having dimensions of 30 meters by 15 meters and a parallelogram with a base of 15 meters, a height of 10 meters, and one side being 12 meters. Calculate the total area of all five levels of the map in square meters.","To calculate the total area of all five levels of the map, we need to calculate the area of each level and then sum them up.

1. The first level is a rectangle:
Area of a rectangle = width × length
Area = 40 meters × 20 meters = 800 square meters

2. The second level is a square:
Area of a square = side length × side length
Area = 15 meters × 15 meters = 225 square meters

3. The third level is a right-angled triangle:
Area of a triangle = 0.5 × base × height
Area = 0.5 × 25 meters × 12 meters = 150 square meters

4. The fourth level is a trapezoid:
Area of a trapezoid = 0.5 × (sum of parallel sides) × height
Area = 0.5 × (10 meters + 20 meters) × 8 meters = 0.5 × 30 meters × 8 meters = 120 square meters

5. The fifth level is an irregular shape that can be broken down into a rectangle and a parallelogram:
- Area of the rectangle = width × length
Area = 30 meters × 15 meters = 450 square meters

- Area of the parallelogram = base × height
Area = 15 meters × 10 meters = 150 square meters

Now, we add the area of the rectangle and the parallelogram to get the total area of the fifth level:
Total area of the fifth level = 450 square meters + 150 square meters = 600 square meters

Finally, we add the areas of all five levels to get the total area of the map:
Total area = 800 square meters + 225 square meters + 150 square meters + 120 square meters + 600 square meters
Total area = 1895 square meters

Therefore, the total area of all five levels of the map is 1895 square meters."
The side of a rhombus is 24 m and the length of one of its diagonals is 18 m. What is the area of the rhombus?,"To find the area of a rhombus when we know the length of one diagonal and the length of the sides, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the sides of the rhombus as \( a \), the known diagonal as \( d_1 \), and the unknown diagonal as \( d_2 \). We know that \( a = 24 \) m and \( d_1 = 18 \) m.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can form two right-angled triangles by drawing one diagonal. Each of these triangles will have sides of length \( \frac{d_1}{2} \) and \( \frac{d_2}{2} \), with the hypotenuse being the side of the rhombus \( a \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ a^2 = \left(\frac{d_1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2 \]

Plugging in the known values:

\[ 24^2 = \left(\frac{18}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2 \]

\[ 576 = 9^2 + \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2 \]

\[ 576 = 81 + \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2 \]

\[ 576 - 81 = \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2 \]

\[ 495 = \left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2 \]

\[ \frac{d_2}{2} = \sqrt{495} \]

\[ d_2 = 2 \sqrt{495} \]

Now, we can find the area of the rhombus using the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{d_1 \times d_2}{2} \]

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{18 \times 2 \sqrt{495}}{2} \]

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \sqrt{495} \]

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \times \sqrt{9 \times 55} \]

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \times 3 \times \sqrt{55} \]

\[ \text{Area} = 54 \sqrt{55} \]

\[ \text{Area} \approx 54 \times 7.416 \] (since \(\sqrt{55} \approx 7.416\))

\[ \text{Area} \approx 400.464 \text{ m}^2 \]

So, the area of the rhombus is approximately \( 400.464 \text{ m}^2 \)."
"In a factory, there are 5 types of machines: M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5, which produce 20%, 25%, 30%, 15%, and 10% of the total products respectively. M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 have defect rates of 2%, 4%, 5%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. Additionally, each machine has an operational efficiency factor, which affects the defect rate as follows: M1 (0.8), M2 (0.9), M3 (0.85), M4 (0.95), and M5 (1.1). Taking into account the operational efficiency factor influencing the individual defect rates, calculate the percentage of non-defective products produced by the factory.","To calculate the percentage of non-defective products produced by the factory, we need to first adjust the defect rates of each machine by their operational efficiency factor and then calculate the weighted average of non-defective rates.

Let's calculate the adjusted defect rates for each machine:

- M1: 2% defect rate * 0.8 efficiency = 1.6% adjusted defect rate
- M2: 4% defect rate * 0.9 efficiency = 3.6% adjusted defect rate
- M3: 5% defect rate * 0.85 efficiency = 4.25% adjusted defect rate
- M4: 7% defect rate * 0.95 efficiency = 6.65% adjusted defect rate
- M5: 8% defect rate * 1.1 efficiency = 8.8% adjusted defect rate

Now, we calculate the percentage of non-defective products for each machine by subtracting the adjusted defect rate from 100%:

- M1: 100% - 1.6% = 98.4% non-defective
- M2: 100% - 3.6% = 96.4% non-defective
- M3: 100% - 4.25% = 95.75% non-defective
- M4: 100% - 6.65% = 93.35% non-defective
- M5: 100% - 8.8% = 91.2% non-defective

Next, we calculate the weighted average of non-defective products based on the production contribution of each machine:

- M1: 98.4% * 20% = 19.68%
- M2: 96.4% * 25% = 24.10%
- M3: 95.75% * 30% = 28.725%
- M4: 93.35% * 15% = 14.0025%
- M5: 91.2% * 10% = 9.12%

Finally, we sum these weighted non-defective percentages to get the overall percentage of non-defective products produced by the factory:

Overall non-defective percentage = 19.68% + 24.10% + 28.725% + 14.0025% + 9.12% = 95.6275%

Therefore, the percentage of non-defective products produced by the factory is 95.6275%."
"David obtained some marks in English, 35 in Mathematics, 52 in Physics, 47 in Chemistry, and 55 in Biology. His average marks are 46.8. What are his marks in English?","To find David's marks in English, we first need to calculate the total marks he obtained in all subjects, and then subtract the marks of the subjects we already know from this total.

The average marks are given as 46.8, and this average is calculated over all subjects, including English. If we let the number of subjects be \( n \), then the total marks obtained in all subjects would be \( 46.8 \times n \).

We know the marks for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, which are 35, 52, 47, and 55 respectively. Let's add these up:

Total marks in known subjects = 35 (Mathematics) + 52 (Physics) + 47 (Chemistry) + 55 (Biology)
Total marks in known subjects = 189

Now, we need to find out the number of subjects (\( n \)) to calculate the total marks. Since we have the marks for 4 subjects and we're looking for the marks in English, the total number of subjects is 5.

Total marks in all subjects = \( 46.8 \times 5 \)
Total marks in all subjects = 234

Now, we can find the marks in English by subtracting the total marks in the known subjects from the total marks in all subjects:

Marks in English = Total marks in all subjects - Total marks in known subjects
Marks in English = 234 - 189
Marks in English = 45

Therefore, David's marks in English are 45."
"A certain number of bricks are required to construct a wall of dimensions 10 m * 4 m * 5 m when 10% of its volume is occupied by mortar. Each brick measures 25 cm in length, 15 cm in width, and some height. There are 6000 bricks needed. What is the height of each brick in centimeters?","First, let's calculate the volume of the wall without the mortar. Since 10% of the volume is occupied by mortar, the volume of bricks will be 90% of the total volume of the wall.

The volume of the wall (V_wall) is:
V_wall = length * width * height
V_wall = 10 m * 4 m * 5 m
V_wall = 200 m³

Now, let's find the volume of bricks (V_bricks) which is 90% of the total volume:
V_bricks = 0.9 * V_wall
V_bricks = 0.9 * 200 m³
V_bricks = 180 m³

We need to convert this volume into cubic centimeters (cm³) because the dimensions of the bricks are given in centimeters:
1 m³ = 100 cm * 100 cm * 100 cm
1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³

So, the volume of bricks in cm³ is:
V_bricks_cm³ = 180 m³ * 1,000,000 cm³/m³
V_bricks_cm³ = 180,000,000 cm³

Now, let's calculate the volume of one brick. The volume of a brick (V_brick) is:
V_brick = length * width * height
V_brick = 25 cm * 15 cm * h cm (where h is the height of the brick)

We know that there are 6000 bricks needed, so the total volume of all bricks is:
Total volume of bricks = V_brick * number of bricks
180,000,000 cm³ = (25 cm * 15 cm * h cm) * 6000

Now, let's solve for the height (h) of each brick:
180,000,000 cm³ = (375 cm² * h) * 6000
180,000,000 cm³ = 2,250,000h cm³
h = 180,000,000 cm³ / 2,250,000 cm²
h = 80 cm

Therefore, the height of each brick is 80 centimeters."
"Find the amount on Rs. 4000 in 2 years, with the rate of interest being a certain percentage for the first year and 5% for the second year. The final amount is Rs. 4368. What is the rate of interest for the first year?","Let's denote the rate of interest for the first year as R%.

The interest for the first year on Rs. 4000 at R% will be (4000 * R * 1) / 100 = 40R.

So, the amount after the first year will be Rs. 4000 + 40R.

For the second year, the interest is at 5%. The interest for the second year on the new amount will be (4000 + 40R) * 5% = (4000 + 40R) * 0.05.

The total amount after two years is given as Rs. 4368.

So, we have:

4000 + 40R + (4000 + 40R) * 0.05 = 4368

Now, let's solve for R:

4000 + 40R + 200 + 2R = 4368

Combine like terms:

40R + 2R = 4368 - 4000 - 200

42R = 168

Divide both sides by 42 to solve for R:

R = 168 / 42

R = 4

Therefore, the rate of interest for the first year is 4%."
Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found some boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens. Zoe had a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing. How many boxes did Zoe find?,"Let's denote the number of boxes Zoe found as B.

Each box contains 4 scarves and 6 mittens, so each box contains a total of 4 + 6 = 10 pieces of winter clothing.

Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing, and since each box contains 10 pieces, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per box:

B = 80 pieces / 10 pieces per box = 8 boxes

So, Zoe found 8 boxes of winter clothing."
"Four people in a law firm are planning a party. Mary will buy a platter of pasta for $20 and a loaf of bread for $2. Elle and Andrea will split the cost for buying 4 cans of soda which cost $1.50 each, and chicken wings for $10. Joe will buy a cake that costs $5. How much more will Mary spend than the rest of the firm put together?","First, let's calculate how much Mary will spend:
Mary's cost = cost of pasta platter + cost of bread
Mary's cost = $20 + $2
Mary's cost = $22

Next, let's calculate how much Elle and Andrea will spend together:
Cost of 4 cans of soda = 4 * $1.50
Cost of 4 cans of soda = $6

Elle and Andrea's total cost = cost of soda + cost of chicken wings
Elle and Andrea's total cost = $6 + $10
Elle and Andrea's total cost = $16

Since Elle and Andrea are splitting the cost, each will pay half:
Each pays = $16 / 2
Each pays = $8

Now, let's calculate how much Joe will spend:
Joe's cost = cost of cake
Joe's cost = $5

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for Elle, Andrea, and Joe:
Total cost for others = Elle's cost + Andrea's cost + Joe's cost
Total cost for others = $8 + $8 + $5
Total cost for others = $21

Now, let's find out how much more Mary will spend than the rest of the firm put together:
Difference = Mary's cost - Total cost for others
Difference = $22 - $21
Difference = $1

Mary will spend $1 more than the rest of the firm put together."
"A 25% stock yielding 20% is quoted at a certain price. Over a 5-year period, the annual inflation rate is 3%, and the stock's market conditions fluctuate by 2% each year. Calculate the adjusted stock price after 5 years, taking into account both the inflation rate and market condition fluctuations.","To calculate the adjusted stock price after 5 years, taking into account both the inflation rate and market condition fluctuations, we need to apply the changes to the stock price year by year.

Let's assume the initial stock price is P (we don't have the actual price, so we'll work with a variable).

1. Calculate the effect of market conditions:
Since the stock's market conditions fluctuate by 2% each year, this could mean an increase or decrease. However, since we don't have the direction of the fluctuation, we'll assume it's an average change of 0% over the long term, as the fluctuations could cancel each other out over time. Therefore, we won't consider market condition fluctuations in our calculation.

2. Calculate the effect of inflation:
The inflation rate is 3% per year. This means that the value of money decreases by 3% each year. To find the price adjusted for inflation, we use the formula:

Adjusted Price = P * (1 - Inflation Rate)^Number of Years

In this case:

Adjusted Price = P * (1 - 0.03)^5

Adjusted Price = P * (0.97)^5

Adjusted Price = P * 0.858735

So, after 5 years, the stock price adjusted for inflation would be approximately 85.8735% of its original value.

Since we don't have the actual initial stock price, we can't calculate the exact adjusted price in currency. However, if you provide the initial stock price, we can calculate the exact adjusted price."
"Mrs. Hilt started by reading 2 books per day, but from the third day, she increased the number of books she read daily by 1. How many books did she read in one week?","Let's calculate the number of books Mrs. Hilt read each day for a week (7 days).

Day 1: 2 books
Day 2: 2 books
Starting from Day 3, she increases the number of books she reads daily by 1.

Day 3: 2 books (initial) + 1 book (increase) = 3 books
Day 4: 3 books (previous day) + 1 book (increase) = 4 books
Day 5: 4 books (previous day) + 1 book (increase) = 5 books
Day 6: 5 books (previous day) + 1 book (increase) = 6 books
Day 7: 6 books (previous day) + 1 book (increase) = 7 books

Now, let's add up the total number of books she read over the week:

2 (Day 1) + 2 (Day 2) + 3 (Day 3) + 4 (Day 4) + 5 (Day 5) + 6 (Day 6) + 7 (Day 7) = 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 29 books

Mrs. Hilt read a total of 29 books in one week."
The amount of principal is Rs. 8000 at compound interest at the ratio of 5% p.a. for 5 years. What is the final amount after 5 years?,"To calculate the final amount after 5 years with compound interest, we can use the formula:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case:
P = Rs. 8000
r = 5% per annum = 0.05 (as a decimal)
n = 1 (since it's compounded annually)
t = 5 years

Now, let's plug these values into the formula:

A = 8000 * (1 + 0.05/1)^(1*5)
A = 8000 * (1 + 0.05)^5
A = 8000 * (1.05)^5

Now, we calculate (1.05)^5:

(1.05)^5 = 1.2762815625

Now, we multiply this by the principal amount:

A = 8000 * 1.2762815625
A = 10210.2525

So, the final amount after 5 years will be Rs. 10210.25 (rounded to two decimal places)."
Find the base of a parallelogram with a certain height if its area is 180 square centimeters and the height is 10 cm.,"The area of a parallelogram can be calculated using the formula:

Area = Base × Height

We are given the area (180 square centimeters) and the height (10 cm), and we need to find the base. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the base:

Base = Area / Height

Substituting the given values:

Base = 180 cm² / 10 cm

Base = 18 cm

So, the base of the parallelogram is 18 centimeters."
"a, b, and c completed a piece of work. a worked for 6 days, b for 9 days, and c for some days. Their daily wages were in the ratio of 3 : 4 : 5. Their total earning was Rs. 1702. The daily wage of c is Rs. 115. How many days did c work?","Let's denote the daily wages of a, b, and c as Wa, Wb, and Wc respectively. According to the problem, the ratio of their daily wages is 3:4:5. We are also given that Wc, the daily wage of c, is Rs. 115.

Since the ratio of their daily wages is 3:4:5, we can write:
Wa : Wb : Wc = 3 : 4 : 5

Given that Wc = Rs. 115, we can find the value of Wa and Wb using the ratio:
Wa / Wc = 3 / 5
Wb / Wc = 4 / 5

Now, let's find the values of Wa and Wb:
Wa = (3/5) * Wc = (3/5) * 115 = Rs. 69
Wb = (4/5) * Wc = (4/5) * 115 = Rs. 92

Now, let's calculate the total earnings of a, b, and c:
Total earnings of a = Wa * number of days a worked = 69 * 6
Total earnings of b = Wb * number of days b worked = 92 * 9
Let's denote the number of days c worked as Dc.
Total earnings of c = Wc * Dc = 115 * Dc

The total earnings of a, b, and c together is Rs. 1702, so we can write the equation:
Total earnings of a + Total earnings of b + Total earnings of c = 1702
69 * 6 + 92 * 9 + 115 * Dc = 1702

Now, let's solve for Dc:
414 + 828 + 115 * Dc = 1702
1242 + 115 * Dc = 1702
115 * Dc = 1702 - 1242
115 * Dc = 460

Now, divide both sides by 115 to find Dc:
Dc = 460 / 115
Dc = 4

Therefore, c worked for 4 days."
"At the salad bar, Grandma put 3 mushrooms on her salad. She also added twice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms, some pickles, and 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles. One third of the bacon bits were red, and Grandma put 32 red bacon bits on her salad. What is the ratio of the number of pickles to the number of cherry tomatoes?","Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Grandma put 3 mushrooms on her salad.
2. She added twice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms, so she added 2 * 3 = 6 cherry tomatoes.
3. She added 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles, but we don't know the number of pickles yet.
4. One third of the bacon bits were red, and she put 32 red bacon bits on her salad. This means the total number of bacon bits is 3 times the number of red bacon bits, so 32 * 3 = 96 bacon bits in total.
5. Since there are 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles, we can find the number of pickles by dividing the number of bacon bits by 4. So, 96 bacon bits / 4 = 24 pickles.

Now we have the number of pickles (24) and the number of cherry tomatoes (6), and we can find the ratio of pickles to cherry tomatoes:

The ratio of pickles to cherry tomatoes is 24:6. To simplify this ratio, we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

24 / 6 = 4
6 / 6 = 1

So, the simplified ratio of pickles to cherry tomatoes is 4:1."
"The ratio of the amount of the oil bill for the month of February to the amount of the oil bill for the month of January was 5 : 4. If the oil bill for February had been some amount more, the corresponding ratio would have been 3 : 2. The oil bill for January was $120. How much more was the oil bill for February in the second scenario?","Let's denote the oil bill for February as \( F \) and the additional amount in the second scenario as \( x \).

From the first scenario, we have the ratio of the oil bill for February to January as 5 : 4. Given that the oil bill for January is $120, we can write the following equation:

\[ \frac{F}{120} = \frac{5}{4} \]

Solving for \( F \), we get:

\[ F = 120 \times \frac{5}{4} \]
\[ F = 150 \]

So, the oil bill for February in the first scenario is $150.

In the second scenario, the ratio of the oil bill for February to January changes to 3 : 2. We need to find the new oil bill for February, which is \( F + x \). The equation for the second scenario is:

\[ \frac{F + x}{120} = \frac{3}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( F \) we found earlier, we get:

\[ \frac{150 + x}{120} = \frac{3}{2} \]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \), we have:

\[ 2(150 + x) = 3(120) \]
\[ 300 + 2x = 360 \]
\[ 2x = 360 - 300 \]
\[ 2x = 60 \]
\[ x = 30 \]

So, the oil bill for February in the second scenario was $30 more than in the first scenario."
"During my workout yesterday, I did 30 squats. Each day, I plan to increase my number of squats by a factorial increment. For example, today I'll do 30 + 1! additional squats, tomorrow I'll do the today's sum + 2! additional squats, and so on. If I do my workout for four consecutive days, how many squats will I perform the day after tomorrow?","Let's calculate the number of squats you'll do each day based on the pattern you've described.

Day 1: You did 30 squats.

Day 2: You'll do 30 + 1! (which is 30 + 1) squats.
1! = 1
So, Day 2 squats = 30 + 1 = 31 squats.

Day 3: You'll do the Day 2 sum + 2! additional squats.
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
So, Day 3 squats = 31 + 2 = 33 squats.

Day 4 (the day after tomorrow): You'll do the Day 3 sum + 3! additional squats.
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
So, Day 4 squats = 33 + 6 = 39 squats.

Therefore, the day after tomorrow, you will perform 39 squats."
"Tom found 15 seashells, and Fred found 43 seashells on the beach. When they cleaned them, they discovered that some were cracked. Fred found 28 more seashells than Tom. How many seashells were cracked?","Let's first find out how many seashells Fred and Tom had in total before they discovered the cracked ones.

Tom found 15 seashells, and Fred found 43 seashells. So together, they found:
15 (Tom's seashells) + 43 (Fred's seashells) = 58 seashells

After cleaning, it was discovered that Fred had 28 more seashells than Tom. This means that the number of seashells Tom had after cleaning is:
15 (Tom's original seashells) - X (cracked seashells Tom had) = Y (Tom's seashells after cleaning)

And the number of seashells Fred had after cleaning is:
43 (Fred's original seashells) - X (cracked seashells Fred had) = Y + 28 (Fred's seashells after cleaning, which is 28 more than Tom's)

Since the number of cracked seashells is the same for both Tom and Fred, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of cracked seashells (2X):

Y (Tom's seashells after cleaning) + Y + 28 (Fred's seashells after cleaning) = 58 (Total seashells they found before cleaning)

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:
(15 - X) + (15 - X + 28) = 58

Simplifying the equation:
30 - 2X + 28 = 58
58 - 2X = 58

Subtracting 58 from both sides:
-2X = 0

Dividing both sides by -2:
X = 0

This means that there were no cracked seashells since X equals 0. All the seashells they found were intact."
"In Cliff's impressive rock collection, there are half as many igneous rocks as sedimentary rocks. Of the igneous rocks, some are shiny and the rest are matte, while 1/5 of the sedimentary rocks are shiny. There are 40 shiny igneous rocks. Cliff has a total of 180 rocks. What is the ratio of shiny igneous rocks to total igneous rocks in Cliff's collection?","Let's denote the total number of sedimentary rocks as S and the total number of igneous rocks as I.

According to the information given, I = 1/2 * S.

We also know that there are 40 shiny igneous rocks. Let's denote the number of shiny igneous rocks as SI. So, SI = 40.

The problem states that 1/5 of the sedimentary rocks are shiny. Therefore, the number of shiny sedimentary rocks (SS) is SS = 1/5 * S.

We also know that Cliff has a total of 180 rocks, which is the sum of sedimentary and igneous rocks. So, S + I = 180.

Since I = 1/2 * S, we can substitute I in the equation:

S + (1/2 * S) = 180
(3/2 * S) = 180
S = 180 * (2/3)
S = 120

Now that we know S, we can find I:

I = 1/2 * S
I = 1/2 * 120
I = 60

Now we have the total number of igneous rocks (I), which is 60, and we know that there are 40 shiny igneous rocks (SI).

The ratio of shiny igneous rocks to total igneous rocks is SI/I:

Ratio = SI/I
Ratio = 40/60
Ratio = 2/3

Therefore, the ratio of shiny igneous rocks to total igneous rocks in Cliff's collection is 2:3."
"If Bill can buy 3 pairs of jeans and 2 shirts for $69 or 2 pairs of jeans and 3 shirts for a certain amount, then one shirt costs $21. How much does Bill spend when he buys 2 pairs of jeans and 3 shirts?","Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as J and the cost of one shirt as S.

According to the information given, we have two equations:

1) For 3 pairs of jeans and 2 shirts, the cost is $69:
3J + 2S = 69

2) We are also told that one shirt costs $21:
S = 21

We can substitute the value of S into the first equation to find the cost of one pair of jeans:

3J + 2(21) = 69
3J + 42 = 69
3J = 69 - 42
3J = 27
J = 27 / 3
J = 9

Now we know that one pair of jeans costs $9 and one shirt costs $21.

To find out how much Bill spends when he buys 2 pairs of jeans and 3 shirts, we use the values we found:

2 pairs of jeans: 2J = 2 * 9 = $18
3 shirts: 3S = 3 * 21 = $63

Adding the cost of jeans and shirts together:

Total cost = 2J + 3S
Total cost = $18 + $63
Total cost = $81

So, Bill spends $81 when he buys 2 pairs of jeans and 3 shirts."
"the cost of 10 kg of mangos is equal to the cost of 24 kg of rice . the cost of 6 kg of flour equals the cost of 2 kg of rice . the cost of each kg of flour is $ 20.50 . find the total cost of 4 kg of mangos , 3 kg of rice and 5 kg of flour ?","Let's denote the cost per kg of mangos as M, the cost per kg of rice as R, and the cost per kg of flour as F.

From the given information, we have:

10M = 24R  (1)
6F = 2R     (2)
F = $20.50  (3)

We can use equation (3) to find the cost of 2 kg of rice using equation (2):

6 * $20.50 = 2R
$123 = 2R
R = $123 / 2
R = $61.50

Now we can find the cost per kg of mangos using equation (1):

10M = 24 * $61.50
10M = $1476
M = $1476 / 10
M = $147.60

Now we have the cost per kg of each item:
Mangos: $147.60/kg
Rice: $61.50/kg
Flour: $20.50/kg

We can now calculate the total cost of 4 kg of mangos, 3 kg of rice, and 5 kg of flour:

Total cost = (4 kg * $147.60/kg) + (3 kg * $61.50/kg) + (5 kg * $20.50/kg)
Total cost = ($590.40) + ($184.50) + ($102.50)
Total cost = $877.40

Therefore, the total cost of 4 kg of mangos, 3 kg of rice, and 5 kg of flour is $877.40."
