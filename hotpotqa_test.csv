The Compromise of 1790 was a compromise between Alexander Hamilton on the one hand and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison whereby Hamilton won the decision for the national government to take over and pay the state debts, while Jefferson and Madison obtained the national capital (District of Columbia) for the South. The compromise resolved the deadlock in Congress. Southerners were blocking the assumption of state debts by the treasury, thereby destroying the Hamiltonian program for building a fiscally strong nation state. Northerners rejected the proposal, much desired by Virginians, to locate the permanent national capital on the Virginia-Maryland border. The compromise made possible the passage of the Residence and Funding (Assumption) Acts in July and August 1790. Historian Jacob Cooke says it is, ""generally regarded as one of the most important bargains in American history, ranking just below the better known Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850."" 

Title: Anti-Nebraska movement

The Anti-Nebraska movement was a political alignment in the United States formed in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and to its repeal of the Missouri Compromise provision forbidding slavery in U.S. territories north of latitude 36° 30' N. (At the time, the name ""Nebraska"" could loosely refer to areas west of the Missouri River.) 

Title: History of the United States Republican Party

The Republican Party, also commonly called the GOP (for ""Grand Old Party""), is one of the world's oldest extant political parties. It is the second oldest existing political party in the United States after its primary rival, the Democratic Party. It emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansas–Nebraska Act, an act that dissolved the terms of the Missouri Compromise and allowed slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty. The Party had almost no presence in the Southern United States, but by 1858 in the North it had enlisted former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats to form majorities in nearly every Northern state. 

Title: William King (governor)

William King (February 9, 1768June 17, 1852) was an American merchant, shipbuilder, army officer, and statesman from Bath, Maine. A proponent of statehood for Maine, he became its first governor when it separated from Massachusetts in 1820. 

Title: Henry Smith Lane

Henry Smith Lane (February 24, 1811 – June 19, 1881) was a United States Representative, Senator, and the 13th Governor of Indiana; he was by design the shortest-serving Governor of Indiana, having made plans to resign the office should his party take control of the Indiana General Assembly and elect him to the United States Senate. He held that office for only two days, and was known for his opposition to slavery. A Whig until the party collapsed, he supported compromise with the south. He became an early leader in the Republican Party starting in 1856 serving as the president of the first party convention, delivering its keynote address, and was influential in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. With the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, he became a full-fledged 

Title: Parallel 36°30′ north

The parallel 36°30′ north is a circle of latitude that is 36 and one-half degrees north of the equator of the Earth. This parallel of latitude is particularly significant in the history of the United States as the line of the Missouri Compromise, which was used to divide the prospective slave and free states west of the Mississippi River, with the exception of Missouri, which is mostly north of this parallel. 

Title: Maine gubernatorial election, 1820

The 1820 Maine gubernatorial election took place on April 3, 1820. It was the first election for Governor of Maine, taking place after Maine separated from Massachusetts and was recognized as a state on March 15, 1820. Maine's separation from Massachusetts came as a result of The Missouri Compromise. This election saw the virtually unanimous election of William King, the man most chiefly responsible for the push for Maine statehood. He had no opponents. 

Title: Pottawatomie massacre

The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856. In reaction to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces, John Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers—some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles—killed five settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas. This was one of the many bloody episodes in Kansas preceding the American Civil War, which came to be known collectively as Bleeding Kansas. Bleeding Kansas was largely brought about by the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas–Nebraska Act. 

Title: Missouri Compromise

The Missouri Compromise is the title generally attached to the legislation passed by the 16th United States Congress on May 8, 1820. The measures provided for the admission of Maine as a state along with Missouri as a slave state, thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South. As part of the compromise, slavery was prohibited North of the 36°30′ parallel, excluding Missouri. President James Monroe signed the legislation on April 6, 1820. 

Title: Dred Scott

Dred Scott (c. 1799 – September 17, 1858) was an enslaved African American man in the United States who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom and that of his wife and their two daughters in the ""Dred Scott v. Sandford"" case of 1857, popularly known as the ""Dred Scott Decision"". Scott claimed that he and his wife should be granted their freedom because they had lived in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory for four years, where slavery was illegal. The United States Supreme Court decided 7–2 against Scott, finding that neither he nor any other person of African ancestry could claim citizenship in the United States, and therefore Scott could not bring suit in federal court under diversity of citizenship rules. Moreover, Scott's temporary residence outside Missouri did not bring about his emancipation under the Missouri Compromise, which the court ruled unconstitutional as it would ""improperly deprive Scott's owner of his legal property"".

Title: Exotic ungulate encephalopathy

Exotic ungulate encephalopathy is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease, identified in infected organs of zoo animals. This subgroup of the TSEs in captive animals was identified in zoo animals in Great Britain including species of greater kudu, nyala, gemsbok, the common eland, Arabian and Scimitar Oryx, an Ankole-Watusi cow, and an American bison. Studies indicate that transmission likely occurred via the consumption of feed supplemented with meat and bone meal, although some animals died after the British ban on ground offal in animal feed. All animals died during the 1990s, with the last death occurring in 1998.

On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe, a 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla. Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe. The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to kill Harambe. A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals in close proximity to humans and the need for better standards of care.

Lifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media. Media – films, television shows, magazines, and more recently, the Internet (i.e. self-written blogs and popular websites) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world. Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate. Celebrity endorsements are prevalent. Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous, whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement. At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like ""Life"", and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination. After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person. The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication. Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide. The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible. The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal, whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film. With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared. Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of word-of-mouth and have tapped into social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to make their wares known. Douglas Kellner writes, ""Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of ""us"" and ""them."""" 

Title: Chin (deity)

In describing the customs of the Mayas inhabiting the Verapaz province (including the Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz) of 16th-century Guatemala, Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas mentions sexual relationships, regulated by customary law, between unmarried young men and boys, as well as similar relations prevailing among adolescents receiving instruction in the temples. Chin, together with Cu, Cavil ('idol'), and Maran, is mentioned as the name of the male deity said to have demonstrated sexual intercourse with another 'demon', and thereby to have introduced such relationships: ""From that time on some fathers gave their sons a little boy to be used as a woman; and if someone else took the boy, they demanded pay as is done when someone violates another's wife."" Institutionalized pederastic prostitution, including transvestism, is recorded in 17th-century Spanish reports of the Itzá Mayas living in the Petén. Among the Classic Period scenes found in a cave of Naj Tunich is a depiction of a naked, sexually excited male creature embracing a nude Maya nobleman, possibly by way of initiation. 

Title: Be Love

Be Love is a Japanese manga magazine targeting women published by Kodansha. It debuted in September 1980. It is one of the leading manga magazines for adult women, the first of its kind, and was instrumental in the rising popularity of josei manga in the 1980s, which led to the creation of other magazines targeted at women such as ""You"" and ""Big Comic for Lady"". As of 2003, ""Be Love"", like ""You"" and ""Jour"", published stories focussing on ""the reality of everyday life"" experienced by its readers. 

Title: Whit Burnett

Whit Burnett (1900–1972) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine ""Story"". In the 1940s, ""Story"" was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors. Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but ""Story"" remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like ""Collier's"" or ""The Saturday Evening Post"" or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as ""The New Yorker"". While ""Story"" paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest-sized magazines of its day, it paid better than most of, and had similar cachet to, the university-based and the other independent ""little magazines"" of its era. 

Title: Kathoey

Kathoey or katoey (Thai: กะเทย ; rtgs: ""Kathoei""  ] ) is a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand. A significant number of Thais perceive ""kathoeys"" as belonging to a third gender, including many ""kathoeys"" themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman. However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as ""phuying"" (Thai: ผู้หญิง ""women""), with a minority referring to themselves as ""phuying praphet song"" (a ""second kind of woman"") and only very few referring to themselves as ""kathoey"". Related phrases include ""phet thi sam"" (Thai: เพศที่สาม , ""third gender""), and ""sao praphet song"" or ""phu ying praphet song"" (Thai: สาวประเภทสอง, ผู้หญิงประเภทสอง — both meaning ""second-type female""). The word ""kathoey"" is of Khmer origin. It is most often rendered as ladyboy or lady boy in English conversation with Thais and this latter expression has become popular across Southeast Asia. 

Title: Pornographic magazine

Pornographic magazines, or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult, sex or top-shelf magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature. Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography, and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral or anal sex, or intercourse. 

Title: Naj

Title: Roller disco

A roller disco is a discothèque or skating rink where all the dancers wear roller skates of some kind (traditional quad or inline). The music played is modern and easily danceable, historically disco but in modern times including almost any form of dance, pop or rock music. The concept originated as a fad in the 1970s when the disco craze was at its height, peaking around 1980 and inspiring several roller-disco magazines. In 1984 the fad arrived in the United Kingdom and many roller discos popped up all over the country s of 2006 , the craze has largely discontinued, although many 1970s era roller-discos are still open and successful. Also, it experienced a mild revival in the early 2000s, especially in the mid-eastern United States , where certain clubs continue to host roller disco nights. Some now use in-line roller-blades. Roller discos are also popular among older children and young teenagers, especially for parties. As in other discos, special effects such as fog machines and flashing traffic lights are often used. To minimise the risk of injury, the organisers of roller discos often only allow participants to skate in one direction at a time, so that they do not crash into one another, although many roller discos have a ""free skate"" section in the middle of the roller rink. 

Title: Alternative press in Nigeria

The Alternative press in Nigeria or the press of the third kind is made up of writers who use militant approaches or viewpoints in news coverage. This usually encompasses guerrilla journalism, a term credited to some Nigerian news magazines for their radical and militant rhetoric and writings usually against the military regimes of the 1990s. The magazines consider themselves to be the last vestige of the common man and viewed certain military governments as usurpers of the people's dreams and yearnings. These magazines are known for their belligerent assault on national leadership and use of secret offices, sometimes called bush offices to print their publications. Some critics have raised ethnic nationalism and cultural coloration as key factors which provided the impetus for most of the rhetoric. 

Title: Woman's Era

The UK parliamentary constituency of Seaford was a Cinque Port constituency, similar to a parliamentary borough, in Seaford, East Sussex. A rotten borough, prone by size to undue influence by a patron, it was disenfranchised in the Reform Act of 1832. It was notable for having returned three Prime Ministers as its members – Henry Pelham, who represented the town from 1717 to 1722, William Pitt the Elder from 1747 to 1754 and George Canning in 1827 – though only Canning was Prime Minister while representing Seaford.

He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous King of Denmark. At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way. By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake). 

Title: Macbeth

Macbeth ( ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, ""Macbeth"" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. 

Title: Revenge tragedy

Revenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England. Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article ""The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,"" which characterizes revenge tragedy ""as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself."" Thomas Kyd's ""The Spanish Tragedy"" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage. However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including ""Troas"" (1559), ""Thyestes"" (1560), and ""Hercules Furens"" (1561). Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play ""Gorbuduc"" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to ""The Spanish Tragedy""). Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" (c.1599-1602) and ""Titus Andronicus"" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's ""The Revenger's Tragedy"" (c.1606).

Title: Shakespearean tragedy

Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as ""histories"" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—""Julius Caesar"", ""Antony and Cleopatra"" and ""Coriolanus""—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the ""problem play,"" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars.

Title: Unpledged elector

In United States presidential elections, an unpledged elector is a person nominated to stand as an elector but who has not pledged to support any particular presidential or vice presidential candidate, and is free to vote for any candidate when elected a member of the Electoral College. Presidential elections are indirect, with voters in each state choosing electors on Election Day in November, and these electors choosing the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in December. Electors today are elected in every state by popular vote, and in practice have since the 19th century almost always agreed in advance to vote for a particular candidate — that is, they are said to have been ""pledged"" to that candidate. In the 20th century, however, several elections were contested by unpledged electors, who made no pledge to any candidate before the election. These anomalies largely arose over fissures within the Democratic Party over the issues of civil rights and segregation. No serious general election campaign has been mounted to elect unpledged electors in any state since 1964.

Title: Fanny's

Fanny's Restaurant was a notable eatery located at 1601 Simpson Street Evanston, IL 60201 USA (the first suburb north of the Chicago City Limits) between 1946 and 1987. It was an anomaly in that it was located in a working-class neighborhood and yet known the world over. Patrons included the Marshall Field Family, of department store fame. Both the salad dressing and meat sauce won the International Epicurian Award of France. It was cited by Chicago Magazine as one of the top 40 Chicago restaurants ever. According to that same Chicago Magazine article Kraft Foods offered $75,000 in 1948 to buy Fanny's salad dressing recipe. This offer was refused. The restaurant was closed due to the deteriorating health of the founder, Fanny Lazar née Bianucci. According to the May 11, 1991 Chicago Sun Times and Chicago Tribune obituaries, Fanny Lazar died at Saint Francis Hospital of Evanston. At some point, possibly in the 1960s, Fanny's products became available on grocery shelves and the business continues on today through mail order. For several years the restaurant building at Simpson Street and Ashland Avenue was shuttered, then later occupied by rental tenants. However, during the condominium boom which occurred in the United States during the first ten years of the 21st Century it was heavily altered and converted into loft spaces. According to a July 5, 1998 Chicago Sun Times article a second version of the restaurant was opened in Union Pier, MI. It appears to remain in business as of 2011, as it can be found through searching local tourism web sites. Fanny's in Union Pier Michigan was located in the Gordon Beach Inn, It's no longer in business. Fanny's meat sauce and salad dressing can still be purchased through World Wide Food Products in Evanston, IL

Title: Nashville Terminal Subdivision

The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee. The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee. The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort. Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as ""LD"" which is part of the Cincinnati Division. From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee. At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash ""Amqui"" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal. Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as ""SA"" and operates on AAR58. There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui. From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track). There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1. Few more miles southward, the next major location appears. At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal. From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago. The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track. From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track. From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike. The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of ""0BA"" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal. At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard. Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals. This location is known as North Radnor. The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta. The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures. The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main. Both lines remain double track for a while. The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0. Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south. From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge. At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40. From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10. After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown. On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present. This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it. The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye. The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic. The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal. The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0. The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 ""11th Avenue"" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track. The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at ""Shops"". Now speed has been increased. The line is still double track until ""Sellars"", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher. For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements. The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3. The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines. The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed. The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel. Crew change usually occurs at the ""walkway"" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower. This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins. Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated. At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now. There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3. About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double. About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names). When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as ""Long Lead"". And now, the Terminal splits into two parts. The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood. The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while. This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line. The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2. Speed is now increased to 40. Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance. Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line. At 00J3.6 known as A-1. Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9). Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line. At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, ""SC"". At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill. There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track. And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad. Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard. Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10. Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192. The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use. The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs. At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1. Speed is now at 40. 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present. This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main. There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track. Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains. This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent. From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip. The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood. Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher. The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.

Information about his life derives from public instead of private documents: vital records, real estate and tax records, lawsuits, records of payments, and references to Shakespeare and his works in printed and hand-written texts.

One of these casks is joined together again by a huge nail (Latin ""clavis""; hence the term, it may also be from Scottish Gaelic ""cliabh"", a basket used for holding combustibles). It is then filled with tar, lighted and carried flaming round the village and finally up to a headland upon which stands the ruins of an altar, locally called the ""Doorie"". It here forms the nucleus of the bonfire, which is built up of split casks. When the burning tar-barrel falls in pieces, the people scramble to get a lighted piece with which to kindle the New Year's fire on their cottage hearth. The charcoal of the ""clavie"" is collected and put in pieces up the cottage chimneys, to keep spirits and witches from coming down.

The diversity of size in breweries is matched by the diversity of processes, degrees of automation, and kinds of beer produced in breweries. A brewery is typically divided into distinct sections, with each section reserved for one part of the brewing process. 

Title: List of microbreweries

This is a list of notable microbreweries. A microbrewery is a brewery which produces a limited amount of beer. The qualifications to be classified as a microbrewery vary by country. The term ""microbrewery"" originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s to describe the new generation of small breweries which focused on producing traditional cask ale. The first successful example of this approach was Litchborough Brewery founded by Bill Urquhart in 1975 in the Northamptonshire village of the same name. Although originally ""microbrewery"" was used in relation to the size of breweries, it gradually came to reflect an alternative attitude and approach to brewing flexibility, adaptability, experimentation, and customer service. The term and trend spread to the United States in the 1980s, where it eventually was used as a designation of breweries that produce fewer than 15,000 U.S. beer barrels (1,800,000 liters) (475,000 U.S. gallons) annually.

The Pod is the second studio album by American rock band Ween, released on September 20, 1991 by Shimmy Disc. The album takes its name from the band's apartment where the album was recorded, which the band nicknamed ""The Pod"".

The copy of the Leonard Cohen record that Ween used had purportedly belonged to Dean Ween's mother, Eileen Ween. ""The Pod"", according to Ween lore, was written under the influence of Scotchgard, but this was later refuted by Gene and Dean themselves as being ""the most slime-bag thing we could think of"".

5ae0a59a55429945ae9593e2,This Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by which empire?,Roman,bridge,hard,"{'title': ['Togodumnus', 'Catuvellauni'], 'sent_id': [0, 0]}","Title: Romano-British culture

Romano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia. It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom. It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain. Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing. 

Title: History of Wales

The history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago. Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or ""Cymru"" in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago, while ""Homo sapiens"" arrived by about 31,000 BC. However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language. The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79. The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion. Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed. The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century. 

Title: Durotriges

The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion. The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island. After the Roman conquest, their main ""civitates"", or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, ""the probable original capital"") and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, ""whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced""). Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae. 

Title: Corieltauvi

The Corieltauvi (formerly thought to be called the Coritani, and sometimes referred to as the Corieltavi) were a tribe of people living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, and thereafter a ""civitas"" of Roman Britain. Their territory was in what is now the English East Midlands. They were bordered by the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east. Their capital was called ""Ratae Corieltauvorum"", known today as Leicester. 

Title: AD 43

AD 43 (XLIII) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vitellius (or, less frequently, year 796 ""Ab urbe condita""). The denomination AD 43 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. 

Title: Togodumnus

Togodumnus (d. AD 43) was a historical king of the British Catuvellauni tribe at the time of the Roman conquest. He can probably be identified with the legendary British king Guiderius. 

Title: Roman conquest of Britain

The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: ""Britannia"" ). Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south. 

Title: Sussex chicken

The Sussex chicken is a dual purpose breed of chicken that originated in England around the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 that is a popular garden chicken in many countries. They come in eight colours (with a couple more being developed) and have a bantam version at 1/4 size; the bantams may be any of the eight colours. 

Title: Catuvellauni

The Catuvellauni were a Celtic tribe or state of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions into the 4th century. 

Title: History of England

England became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago, as the discovery of flint tools and footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk has revealed. The earliest evidence for early modern humans in North West Europe, a jawbone discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927, was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old. Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago (see Creswellian), at the end of the last glacial period. The region has numerous remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, such as Stonehenge and Avebury. In the Iron Age, England, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons, including some Belgic tribes (e.g. the Atrebates, the Catuvellauni, the Trinovantes, etc.) in the south east. In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began; the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia until the early 5th century.

Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) is a cryptid which supposedly is a simian-like creature of American folklore that is said to inhabit forests, especially in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. The term ""sasquatch"" is an Anglicized derivative of the Halkomelem word ""sásq'ets"". 

Title: Hidebehind

The Hidebehind is a nocturnal fearsome critter from American folklore that preys upon humans that wander the woods, and was credited for the disappearances of early loggers when they failed to return to camp. As its name suggests, the Hidebehind is noted for its ability to conceal itself. When an observer attempts to look directly at it, the creature hides again behind an object or the observer and therefore can't be directly seen: a feat it accomplishes by sucking in its stomach to a point where it is so slender that it can easily cover itself behind the trunk of any tree. The Hidebehind uses this ability to stalk human prey without being observed and to attack without warning. Their victims, including lumberjacks who frequent the forests, are dragged back to the creature's lair to be devoured. The creature subsists chiefly upon the intestines of its victim, and has a severe aversion to alcohol, which is considered a sufficient repellent. Tales of the Hidebehind may have helped explain strange noises in the forest at night. Early accounts describe hidebehinds as large, powerful animals, despite the fact that no one was able to see them.

In 1917 he earned his M.A. in social science and history at Harvard University. __During World War I, he served with the Tenth Infantry of the Forty-Sixth Division and also served as an army sergeant in Intelligence.

The most widely recognized is ""Rocky Mountain Tales"", which presents regional folklore as well as true accounts of early events in the area. Levette Davidson died May 14, 1957.

Dance moves or dance steps (more complex dance moves are called dance patterns, dance figures, dance movements, or dance variations) are usually isolated, defined, and organized so that beginning dancers can learn and use them independently of each other. However, more complex movements are influenced by musicality and lyrical relevance to express emotions or refer to a message. 

Title: Decoded neurofeedback

Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is the process of inducing knowledge in a subject by increasing neural activation in predetermined regions of interest in the brain, such as their visual cortex. This is achieved by measuring neural activity in these regions via functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), comparing this to the ideal pattern of neural activation in these regions (for the intended purpose), and giving subjects feedback on how close their current pattern of neural activity is to the ideal pattern. Without explicit knowledge of what they are supposed to be doing or thinking about, over time participants learn to induce this ideal pattern of neural activation. Corresponding to this, their 'knowledge' or way of thinking has been found to change accordingly. 

Title: Cis AB

Cis AB is a rare mutation in the ABO gene which complicates the basic inheritance pattern and blood-transfusion compatibility matching for ABO blood typing. There are different DNA mutations of either type A or Type B alleles that change several amino acids in enzyme transferase A or B, homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A). A single change in ABO gene DNA could reverse type B to type A and then, a new hybrid enzyme will produce both weak B and A2 (in serum test, A2B and A2B3)). The most common mutation is an A105 allele variation in exon 7 nucleotide position G803C changing Glycine (type A) to Alanine (type B). There are another 8 alleles reported in BGMUT, the most discovered reciently in China and Taiwan. In the cis-AB genotype, both antigens are expressed, like in a standard (trans) AB genotype. In a traditional AB phenotype, A and B antigenes are inherited separately from the father and mother while a cis-AB allele comes from one parent only. In a serum test, cis-AB tests almost the same as a traditional AB, but people with this rare type have problems with blood transfusions. Some of them need components like washed red blood cells or autotransfusion of serum and blood. 

Title: Chicken (dance)

The Chicken is a popular rhythm and blues dance started in America in the 1950s, in which the dancers flapped their arms and kicked back their feet in an imitation of a chicken. The dance featured lateral body movements. It was used primarily as a change of pace step while doing the Twist. The chicken dance gained even more popularity when Rufus Thomas wrote ""Do the Funky Chicken"", a hit record in 1970. 

Title: Bugaku

Bugaku (舞楽 , court dance and music) is the Japanese traditional dance that has been performed to select elites mostly in the Japanese imperial court, for over twelve hundred years. In this way, it has been known only to the nobility, although after World War II, the dance was opened to the public and has even toured around the world in 1959. The dance is marked by its slow, precise and regal movements. The dancers wear intricate traditional Buddhist costumes, which usually include equally beautiful masks. The music and dance pattern is often repeated several times. It is performed on a square platform, usually 6 yards by 6 yards. 

Title: African-American dance

African-American dance has developed within Black American communities in everyday spaces, rather than in studios, schools or companies. These dances are usually centered on folk and social dance practice, though performance dance often supplies complementary aspects to this. Placing great value on improvisation, these dances are characterized by ongoing change and development. There are a number of notable African-American modern dance companies using African-American cultural dance as an inspiration, amongst these are the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Dance Theatre of Harlem, and Lula Washington Dance Theatre. Unlike European-American dance, African-American dance was not taxed in the fields of Europe where it began and has not been presented in theatrical productions by generations of kings, tzars, and states. Instead, it lost its best dancers to the draft and started requiring taxes from establishments in the form of a federal excise tax on dance halls enacted in 1944. Dance halls continue to be taxed throughout the country while dance studios are not, and African-American dance companies statistically receive less than taxpayer money than European-Americans. However, Hollywood and Broadway have provided wonderful opportunities for African-American artists to share their work and for the public to support them. Michael Jackson and Beyonce are the most well-known African-American dancers. 

Title: Dynamic speckle

In physics, dynamic speckle is a result of the temporal evolution of a speckle pattern where variations in the scattering elements responsible for the formation of the interference pattern in the static situation produce the changes that are seen in the speckle pattern, where its grains change their intensity (grey level) as well as their shape along time. One easy to observe example is milk: place some milk in a teaspoon and observe the surface in direct sunlight. You will see a ""dancing"" pattern of coloured points. Where the milk dries on the spoon at the edge, the speckle is seen to be static. This is direct evidence of the thermal motion of atoms, which cause the Brownian motion of the colloidal particles in the milk, which in turn results in the dynamic speckle visible to the naked eye. 

Title: V6 (Quickstep)

V6 is a ""silver"" level dance pattern of the quickstep International Standard Ballroom dance syllabus. The couple moves diagonally to the center (DC) and then diagonally to the wall (DW), thus sweeping a V-shape on the floor. 

Title: Frug (dance)

The Frug ( or ""froog"") was a dance craze from the mid-1960s, which included vigorous dance to pop music. It evolved from another dance of the era, the Chicken. The Chicken, which featured lateral body movements, was used primarily as a change of pace step while doing the Twist. As young dancers grew more tired they would do less work, moving only their hips while standing in place. They then started making up arm movements for the dance, which prompted the birth of the Swim, the Monkey, the Dog, the Watusi, the Mashed Potato, and the Jerk. The Frug is sometimes referred to as the Surf, Big Bea, and the Thunderbird. 

Title: Compulsory dance

Compulsory dances, now called pattern dance in ice dancing, are a part of ice dancing and artistic roller skating in which all the couples or solo dancers perform the same standardized steps and holds to music of a specified tempo and genre. One or more compulsory dances were usually skated as the first phase of ice dancing competitions. The 2009-10 season was the final season in which the segment was competed in ISU junior and senior level competition. In June 2010, the International Skating Union replaced the name ""compulsory dance"" with ""pattern dance"" for ice dancing, and merged it into the short dance beginning in the 2010–2011 figure skating season. Compulsory dances are still skated in international roller skating competitions, however as in ice skating, a new section called the Style Dance was introduced from the 2015/16 season alongside the standard compulsory dances and freedance categories. The style dance is very similar in structure to the short dance on ice.

The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be free of sin and perfect in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called ""Perfectionism""). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), complex marriage, male sexual continence, and mutual criticism. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878.

Title: Margarodidae

The Margarodidae or ground pearls (cottony cushion scales, giant coccids, giant scale insects) are a family of scale insects within the superfamily Coccoidea. Members of the family include the Polish cochineal and Armenian cochineal (genus ""Porphyrophora"") and the original ground pearl genus, ""Margarodes"". Beginning in 1880, a number of distinct subfamilies were recognized, with the giant coccis (the Monophlebidae) being the first. Although Maskell proposed a new family, many continued to regard the monophlebids as a mere subfamily for many years, and the Margarodidae classification continued to be polyphyletic through the 20th Century. Since then, taking the advice of Koteja several subfamilies and tribes have been elevated into their own families such as Matsucoccidae and Xylococcidae. The pared-down family of Margarodidae (Margarodidae ""sensu stricto"" or Margarodidae s. s.) is monophyletic.

Crossosperma is a genus of shrubs in the family Rutaceae. The genus is endemic to New Caledonia in the Pacific and contains two species. Its closest relative is the Australian ""Acradenia"". 

Title: Hachettea

Hachettea austrocaledonica is a species of parasitic plant in the Balanophoraceae family. It is endemic to New Caledonia and the only species of the genus Hachettea. Its closest relative is ""Dactylanthus"" from New Zealand. 

Title: Bombyx mandarina

Bombyx mandarina, the wild silkmoth, is an insect from the moth family Bombycidae. It is the closest relative of ""Bombyx mori"" the domesticated silkmoth or ""silkworm"" (properly, this refers to the caterpillars only). Unlike the domesticated relative which is unable to fly or indeed persist outside human care, the wild silkmoth is a fairly ordinary lepidopteran. Its main difference from the domesticated taxon is the more slender body with well-developed wings in males, and the dull greyish-brown color. 

Title: Hippopotamus

The common hippopotamus (""Hippopotamus amphibius""), or hippo, is a large, mostly herbivorous and aggressive mammal in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (""Choeropsis liberiensis"" or ""Hexaprotodon liberiensis""). The name comes from the ancient Greek for ""river horse"" (ἱπποπόταμος ). After the elephant and rhinoceros, the common hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl. Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc.) from which they diverged about . The common ancestor of whales and hippos split from other even-toed ungulates around . The earliest known hippopotamus fossils, belonging to the genus ""Kenyapotamus"" in Africa, date to around . 

Title: Daenikera

Daenikera corallina is a species of parasitic in the Santalaceae family. It is endemic to New Caledonia and the only species of the genus Daenikera. Its closest relative is ""Amphorogyne"", also endemic to New Caledonia. 

Title: Occidens (tetrapod)

Occidens is an extinct genus of stem tetrapod that lived during the earliest part of the Carboniferous in what is now Northern Ireland. It is known from a single type species, Occidens portlocki, named in 2004 on the basis of a left lower jaw that British geologist Joseph Ellison Portlock described in 1843. Portlock attributed it to the lobe-finned fish ""Holoptychius"" and it was housed in the collections of the British Geological Survey for over a century before being reevaluated in 2004 by vertebrate paleontologists Jenny Clack and Per E. Ahlberg, who reclassified it as a new genus and species of early tetrapod. The genus name ""Occidens"" refers to its presence west of better-known early tetrapod assemblages in Great Britain, and the species name honors Portlock. The jaw likely comes from the Altagoan Formation and, based on an analysis of fossilized pollen, dates to the late Tournaisian stage of the Early Carboniferous about 350 million years ago. The occurrence of ""Occidens"" in the Tournaisian makes it a critically important taxon because it lies within Romer's gap, a time interval spanning most of the Early Carboniferous in which almost no tetrapod fossils are known. Romer's gap separates the first appearance of tetrapods in the Late Devonian from the group's first evolutionary radiation toward the end of the Early Carboniferous. However, the relationship of ""Occidens"" to other early tetrapods both before and after the gap remain uncertain, which means that its context in tetrapod evolution remains unknown. Clack and Ahlberg noted several distinctive features of ""Occidens"", including a straight row of teeth along the coronoid bones on the inner surface of the lower jaw, an open groove for a lateral line sense organ on the jaw's outer surface, and a stepped shape to the connection between the dentary and angular bones. The jaw bone is deep, resembling those of ""Crassigyrinus"" and whatcheeriids (which both occur in Romer's gap) in overall appearance. In most phylogenetic trees produced by Clack and Ahlberg's 2004 analysis, ""Occidens"" fell near whatcheeriids and the Devonian taxon ""Tulerpeton"", being more derived than all other Devonian taxa and more basal than ""Crassigyrinus"" and the post-Romer's Gap taxa ""Greererpeton"" and ""Megalocephalus"". A 2008 phylogenetic analysis by paleontologists Marcello Ruta and John Bolt found ""Occidens"" to be the closest relative of ""Sigournea multidentata"", a species from the end of the gap found in Iowa, but could not determine where these two taxa fit relative to other Early Carboniferous tetrapods. 

Title: Carusia

Carusia is an extinct genus of lizard from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. It is a close relative of the family Xenosauridae, which includes living knob-scaled lizards. Fossils of the type and only species Carusia intermedia come from the late-Campanian age Barun Goyot Formation and have been found in the Flaming Cliffs, Ukhaa Tolgod, and Kheerman Tsav fossil localities. ""Carusia"" was first described in 1985 under the name ""Carolina intermedia"", but since the name ""Carolina"" was preoccupied by a genus of scarab beetles that had been named in 1880, it was renamed ""Carusia intermedia"". ""Carusia"" had initially been known from fragmentary skull material, complicating efforts to determine its evolutionary relationships with other lizards; it had variously been described as an indeterminate scincomorph, a xenosaurid, or some other type of autarchoglossan lizard convergent with xenosaurids. However, the discovery of 35 complete skulls in the 1990s, three of which were described in a detailed 1998 monograph, revealed that ""Carusia"" was the sister taxon (closest relative) of Xenosauridae, compelling the authors of the monograph to create a new clade called Carusioidea to include both taxa. 

Title: Mascarene teal

The Mascarene teal (""Anas theodori""), also known as Sauzier's teal and Mauritian duck, is an extinct dabbling duck that formerly occurred on the islands of Mauritius and Réunion. It was a small teal of the ""Anas gibberifrons"" superspecies of the ""Anas"" subgenus ""Nettion"". Its closest relative is probably Bernier's teal from Madagascar and, apart from having stronger wings and being considerably bigger (between a Sunda teal and a mallard in size), it seems to have looked very similar to that species. Earlier, it was proposed that Meller's duck, also from Madagascar, is the closest living relative of ""A. theodori"", but as more remains of the latter were unearthed this appears far less likely. Apart from a few, brief descriptions, not much is known about the bird in life, but its habits probably did not differ significantly from those of its close relatives. Bones have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp on Mauritius and more recently on Réunion also. The scientific name honours Thé́odore Sauzier, who made many bones of extinct birds found on Mauritius available to science. 

Title: Gerobatrachus

Gerobatrachus is an extinct genus of amphibamid temnospondyl (represented by the type species Gerobatrachus hottoni) that lived in the Early Permian, approximately 290 million years ago (Ma), in the area that is now Baylor County, Texas. When it was first described in 2008, ""Gerobatrachus"" was announced to be the closest relative of Batrachia, the group that includes modern frogs and salamanders. It possesses a mixture of characteristics from both groups, including a large frog-like head and a salamander-like tail. These features have led to it being dubbed a frogamander by the press. Some more recent studies place ""Gerobatrachus"" as the closest relative of Lissamphibia, the group that contains all modern amphibians including frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, or place modern amphibians far from ""Gerobatrachus"" within a group called Lepospondyli. 

Title: Whale

Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).

Title: Acclimatisation society

Acclimatisation societies were voluntary associations in the 19th and 20th centuries that encouraged the introduction of non-native species in various places around the world with the hope of their acclimatisation and adaptation. The motivation at the time was a sense that introducing these species of plants and animals would enrich the flora and fauna of a region . These societies were born during a period of colonialism when Europeans began to settle in unfamiliar environments, and the movement sought to establish familiar plants and animals (mainly from Europe) in new areas while also bringing exotic and useful foreign plants and animals into the European centres. Today it is widely understood that introducing species can be harmful to native species and their ecosystems; for example, in Australia plants were harmed by rabbits' overgrazing; in North America house sparrows displace and kill native birds; and around the world, salamander populations are today threatened by introduced fungal infections. At the time of acclimatisation societies, however, this was insufficiently understood . 

Title: Do not feed the animals

The prohibition ""do not feed the animals"" reflects a policy forbidding the artificial feeding of wildlife (wild or feral animals) in situations where the animals, or the people doing the feeding, might be harmed. Signs displaying this message are commonly found in zoos, circuses, animal theme parks, aquariums, national parks, parks, public spaces, farms, and other places where people come into contact with wildlife. In some cases there are laws to enforce such no-feeding policies. However, some people (such as some of those who enjoy feeding pigeons in cities) openly and strongly oppose such laws claiming that animals such as pigeons can be an amenity for people who do not have company such as friends or family, and say that the laws prohibiting feeding animals in urban places must change. In some countries, such as Greece, feeding the pigeons in cities is a widespread practice. Cultural hostility to feeding animals in cities and laws that ban the practice raise concerns about how humans relate to other living beings in the urban environment. Politicians have also protested laws that ban feeding feral pigeons in cities. Feral pigeons in cities existed for thousands of years but only recently in some countries humans started seeing them as a nuisance and became hostile to them. In India, feeding feral animals in cities is considered a noble act. Academicians say that how humans treat animals is related to how humans treat each other and thus raise concerns about the cultural shift from seeing feral city pigeons as harmless in the 1800s to seeing them a undesirable in some countries in the 2000s. 

Title: American Humane Association

It has also run the Red Star Animal Emergency Services since 1916. In 2000, American Humane formed the Farm Animal Services program, an animal welfare label system for food products.

Tao Yuanming spent most of his life in reclusion, living in a small house in the countryside, reading, drinking wine, receiving the occasional guest, and writing poems in which he often reflected on the pleasures and difficulties of life in the countryside, as well as his decision to withdraw from civil service. His simple, direct, and unmannered style was at odds with the norms for literary writing in his time. Although he was relatively well-known as a recluse poet in the Tang dynasty (618-907), it was not until the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127), when influential literati figures such as Su Shi (1037-1101) declared him a paragon of authenticity and spontaneity in poetry, that Tao Yuanming would achieve lasting literary fame. He is also regarded as the foremost representative of what would latter be known as Fields and Gardens poetry, a style of landscape poetry that found inspiration in the beauty and serenity of the natural world close at hand.

Title: Broadway Rose Theatre Company

In 1991, seven years after meeting in a summer stock production of ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania, Dan Murphy and Sharon Maroney (married), along with fellow performer Matthew Ryan (a native of Tigard, OR) and his partner Joseph Morkys, decided to move from New York City to start a summer stock theatre in Tigard. The team pooled their savings of $21,000 and in November 1991, Broadway Rose Theatre Company was incorporated as a 501(c)(3). In the summer of 1992, the first season of Broadway Rose Theatre Company was performed at the Deb Fennell Auditorium at Tigard High School. The company produced five mainstage shows and a children's show in eight weeks, with an average audience of 32 people per performance. The company lost $8,700 in its first season, but the following year the fledgling company received a $3,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission (a forerunner of the Regional Arts & Culture Council), to help bring the organization out of debt. In 1993, the company produced ""Oklahoma!"" with no funds—putting the entire payroll on Dan's personal credit card. The situation resolved itself as audiences picked up. In 1994, the company received a $4,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission. Audiences averaged 132 people per performance that year—a 313 percent increase from 1992. In 1995, The Collins Foundation provided the company a $5,000 grant, allowing Sharon Maroney to become the company's first paid employee. Platt Electric Supply became Broadway Rose's first title sponsor in 1996, providing a new level of stable funding (they would stay on as a title sponsor through 2012 when Harvey Platt sold the company). In 1997, co-founders Matthew Ryan and Joe Morkys left Broadway Rose and returned to New York. That year Broadway Rose held its first drama camp for young performers aged 8–11. Also in 1997, Shoshana Bean, who would later become famous for portraying Elphaba on Broadway in the musical ""Wicked"""","" starred in the Broadway Rose production of ""Bye Bye Birdie."" The company's offices moved from Dan and Sharon's home to a Platt Electric Supply branch office in 1999. Later that year, the Sherwood Arts Council contracted Broadway Rose to produce ""Broadway Goes Hollywood"", a fundraiser for SAC held at the historic Robin Hood Theater in Sherwood, OR. Broadway Rose's annual budget rose to around $175,000 with ticket sales accounting for just under half of the total, and Dan's general manager position officially became funded, making him an employee rather than a volunteer.

More importantly, the nationalists in the Battle of Siping was in name only, because they were former nationalists (mostly warlords ostensively under nationalist reign) turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after World War II, and the local bandits recruited by the nationalist administrators to fight off communists, since Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist regime simply did not have the resource to rapidly deploy his forces into the region. In fact, in the Battle of Siping, Chiang’s own force did not even participated in the fights.

Title: Portuguese poetry

The beginnings of Portuguese poetry go back to the early 12th century, around the time when the County of Portugal separated from the medieval Kingdom of Galicia in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It was in this region that the ancestral language of both modern Portuguese and modern Galician, known today as Galician-Portuguese, was the common language of the people. Like the troubadour culture in the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe, Galician-Portuguese poets sang the love for a woman, which often turned into personal insults, as she had hurt her lover's pride. However, this region produced a specific type of song, known as ""cantigas de amigo"" (songs of a friend). In these, the lyrical subject is always a woman (though the singer was male) talking about her friend (lover) from whom she has been separated - by war or other activities - as shown in the Reconquista. They discuss the loneliness that the woman feels. But some poems also project eroticism, or confess the lover's meeting in a secret place, often through a dialogue she has with her mother or with natural elements (such could be considered a custom adapted from the pagan peoples in the region). Epic poetry was also produced, as was common in Romantic medieval regions (""Gesta de D. Afonso Henriques"", of unknown authorship).

Title: List of female Indian governors

In India, a governor is the constitutional head of each of the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is ""de jure"" head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold ""de facto"" executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor. The union territories of Andaman and Nicobar, Delhi and Puducherry are headed by lieutenant-governors.

Title: Cuthy Mede

Lonely Planet said ""possibly the best-known [Malawian] artist is Cuthy Mede – he is also actively involved in the development and promotion of Malawian art within the country and around the world."" Cuthy Mede grew up on Likoma Island, Lake Malawi where he drew in the rough sands of the beach as a child. Later he studied Fine Art in Chancellor College and became a lecturer at the College in the 1970s. By the 1980s Mede established Gallerie Africaine in Lilongwe City Centre, the first art gallery by a local artist in Malawi. Mede exhibited his work widely in Malawi, becoming a successful artist selling his work to international collectors. Mede encouraged the work of young Malawian artists struggling to make a living selling folk art and wood carvings as street traders. He also brought fine art work from other Malawian artists into his Gallery. He was commissioned to paint a large mural decorating the City Centre. Mede is best known for his modern art styles: modern, futurist, cubist and pointillist, with strong local themes. His paintings depicted local people, historic events and current events in Malawi, Biblical references with local interpretations, indigenous religious expressions, and paintings about ideas such as Justice, Greed, Man and Machine. His paintings depict famine, refugees from Mozambique during the Civil War, voting and democracy, wedding celebration, spirits and possession, and the Nyau masquerade. Mede's less known work is realistic, including a reproduction of the Mona Lisa. His best known work is dominated by bright primary colors, cubist style, though his pointillist work favors ochres and softer tones in the overall effect. In later years Mede painted mostly in shades of blue, then white on white, the purest light. Mede is an evangelical Christian and his work begins with a point of light from which the rest of the painting flows, the energy from God. This point of light is evident in most of his paintings as a single dot, a sun or moon, or an orb. Best known for his paintings, Mede also produced sculptural forms such as wood figures covered in beads and pigments. His garden in Lilongwe was made into a work of art, in white and light, with fluorescent light tubes hanging from trees and white painted rocks lining the drive and entry. Mede's wife, Esther (deceased 2009), served as Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Research and Environmental Affairs in the Malawi government.

Title: WSYY-FM

WSYY-FM (94.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week (from 4:55AM through 11:10PM ET) under the slogan, """"Radio With An Attitude"""". Playing a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers, the station broadcasts an Adult Hits/Full-Service format for approximately 16 hours per day, from 6:00AM through 10:00PM ET (reserving the first and, also, the final hour of their broadcast day to ""When Radio Was""). ""The Mountain 94.9"" carries local high school sports in season. ""The Mountain 94.9"" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on ""The Mountain 94.9"" during Baseball season). The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades). Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located. The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc. WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9. Prior to their ""The Mountain 94.9"" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as ""North Country 95"", airing a full-time Country Music format. The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent. Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location). On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC. WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates—apart from WLOB—of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show. WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET). In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk. In favorable atmospheric conditions, a very weak signal of WHOM can be DX-ed in Millinocket during overnight hours (when WSYY-FM is off-the-air).

Equipment for tea ceremony is called ""dōgu"" (道具; lit., ""tools""), or more specifically ""chadōgu"" (茶道具; ""tea tools""). ""Chadōgu"" can be divided into five major categories: ""sōshoku dōgu"" (装飾道具; ""decorative items""); ""temae dōgu"" (点前道具; ""items for the tea-making and service""); ""kaiseki dōgu"" (懐石道具; ""items for the ""chakaiseki"" meal""); ""mizuya dōgu"" (水屋道具; ""items used in the preparation room""); and ""machiai dōgu / roji"" ""dōgu"" (待合道具・露地道具; ""items for the waiting room"" / ""items for the ""roji"" garden"").

This article, however, includes all forms of implements and paraphernalia involved in the practice of ""chanoyu"". 

Title: Indexed unit of account

When a daily indexed unit of account or Daily Consumer Price Index (Daily CPI) or monetized daily indexed unit of account is used in contracts or in the Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power accounting model, deferred payments and constant real value non-monetary items are indexed to the general price level in terms of a Daily Index such that changes in the inflation rate - in the case of monetary items - and the stable measuring unit assumption - in the case of constant real value non-monetary items - have no effect on the real value of these items. Non-indexed units, such as contracts written in nominal currency units and nominal monetary items, incur inflation or deflation risk in the case of monetary items. During all periods of inflation (low, high or hyperinflation), the debtor pays less in real terms than what both the debtor and creditor agreed at the original time of the contract/sale. On the other hand, in periods of deflation, the debtor pays more in real terms than the original agreed value. The opposite is true for creditors. Contracts and constant real value non-monetary items accounted in daily indexed units of account, Daily CPI or monetized daily indexed units of account incur no inflation or deflation risk, as the real value of payments and outstanding capital amounts remain constant over time while the nominal values are inflation- or deflation-indexed daily.

Title: Bayley Scales of Infant Development

The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III is the current version) is a standard series of measurements originally developed by psychologist Nancy Bayley used primarily to assess the development of infants and toddlers, ages 1–42 months. This measure consists of a series of developmental play tasks and takes between 45 – 60 minutes to administer and derives a developmental quotient (DQ) rather than an intelligence quotient (IQ). Raw scores of successfully completed items are converted to scale scores and to composite scores. These scores are used to determine the child's performance compared with norms taken from typically developing children of their age (in months). The most recent edition, the Bayley-III has three main subtests; the Cognitive Scale, which includes items such as attention to familiar and unfamiliar objects, looking for a fallen object, and pretend play, the Language Scale, which taps understanding and expression of language, for example, recognition of objects and people, following directions, and naming objects and pictures, and the Motor Scale, which assesses gross and fine motor skills such as grasping, sitting, stacking blocks, and climbing stairs. There are two additional Bayley-II Scales depend on parental report, including the Social-Emotional scale, which asks caregivers about such behaviors as ease of calming, social responsiveness, and imitation play, and the Adaptive Behavior scale which asks about adaptions to the demands of daily life, including communication, self-control, following rules, and getting along with others. The Bayley-III Cognitive and Language scales are good predictors of preschool mental test performance. These scores are largely used for screening, helping to identify the need for further observation and intervention, as infants who score very low are at risk for future developmental problems.

Title: Functional item

In the framework of Noam Chomsky's Minimalist Program, items of the lexicon are of two types: with or without substantive content. Items of the former category are called lexical items, whereas items of the latter category are functional items. Functional items carry the grammatical content of a sentence, which means that by taking them out of the sentence one would still understand the meaning, although it would not be grammatical. In other words, they are the 'glue' that holds the sentence together. Functional items can also be classified as closed class, that is, belonging to parts of speech that do not easily allow new members. If functional items are removed from a sentence, the words that would be left are the lexical items. The lexical items of a sentence are those that are used in telegraphic speech; functional items are the grammatical units that hold the sentence together and make it more fluid. Functional Items are feature sets. Functional items include two type of morphemes. Free morphemes, like modals, auxiliaries, determiners, complementizers, and bound morphemes such as nominal and verbal affixes. Though functional items have feature structure, the do not enter into θ-marking.

The name is derived from the act of catching a player between two bases at the end of a batting round, referred to as ""burning"" them (""bränna""), roughly equivalent to being run out in cricket or out in baseball. The world championship, called Brännbollscupen, is an annual event in the Swedish city of Umeå. 

Title: Home accessories

Home accessories are furniture items which are easy to replace and easy to move, and include almost any items that aren't strictly functionally necessary in the decorated space.

Title: Mount Hornsby

Mount Hornsby ( ) is a prominent snow-capped mountain on the south side of the middle reaches of Sjogren Glacier, Trinity Peninsula, Antarctica. It was mapped from surveys by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (1960–61), and was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, who designed and constructed several highly successful chain-track vehicles for the British War Office, the first ""caterpillar tractors,"" in the years 1904–10. 

Title: Crude oil engine

The crude oil engine is a type of internal combustion engine similar to the hot bulb engine. A crude oil engine could be driven by all sorts of oils such as engine waste oil and vegetable oils. Even peanut oil and butter could be used as fuel if necessary. Like hot bulb engines, crude oil engines were mostly used as stationary engines or in boats. They can run for a very long time; for instance, at the world fair in Milan in 1906, a FRAM engine was started and ran until the exhibition was over one month later. A crude oil engine is a low RPM engine dimensioned for constant running and can last for a very long time if maintained properly. It was later replaced by the diesel engine. 

Title: Oil engine

An oil engine is an internal combustion engine that is powered by the burning of fuel oil, as opposed to external combustion engines, such as steam engine. The term usually refers to low compression engines, so the diesel engine is usually not included.

The Highwater experiment sought to determine the effect of a large volume of water suddenly released into the ionosphere. The project answered questions about the effect of the diffusion of propellants in the event that a rocket was destroyed at high altitude. 

Title: H-T Ranch

H-T Ranch is a historic ranch complex 10 mi west of Amidon, North Dakota. The ranch originally consisted of ten buildings; however, only the ranch house and log barn survive. The ranch served as the headquarters of the Little Missouri Cattle Company, which was run by Arthur Clark Hidekoper. Hidekober established the ranch in the 1880s, and by the end of the decade, it had become the ""most notable"" ranch in the area. The ranch house, called Shackford, was built in 1896; its uncommon style resembles a bungalow but also borrows from other styles such as the Stick style. By 1906, the ""Fargo Forum"" described the ranch as ""the biggest and most important [ranch] in the state"" and ""one of the largest horse raising outlets in the world"". In the same year, Hidekoper sold the 70,000 acre ranch; the sale was the largest land deal in North Dakota history. After the sale, a land company reduced the ranch to 5000 acre ; it was later used as a dude ranch in the 1920s.

Blue Origin is developing a variety of technologies, with a focus on rocket-powered Vertical Takeoff and Vertical Landing (VTVL) vehicles for access to suborbital and orbital space. The company's name refers to the blue planet, Earth, as the point of origin. 

Title: Apollo 7

Apollo 7 was an October 1968 human spaceflight mission carried out by the United States. It was the first mission in the United States' Apollo program to carry a crew into space. It was also the first U.S. spaceflight to carry astronauts since the flight of Gemini XII in November 1966. The AS-204 mission, also known as ""Apollo 1"", was intended to be the first manned flight of the Apollo program. It was scheduled to launch in February 1967, but a fire in the cabin during a January 1967 test killed the crew. Manned flights were then suspended for 21 months, while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements made to the spacecraft and safety procedures, and unmanned test flights of the Saturn V rocket and Apollo Lunar Module were made. Apollo 7 fulfilled Apollo 1's mission of testing the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) in low Earth orbit.

Christiansen was born in Oslo, Norway in 1923 and became an American citizen in 1939. He later served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and the Korean Conflict. He began experimental flying for Lockheed Martin in 1953, and worked there until his retirement in 1984. He was a fellow at Society of Experimental Test Pilots. 

Title: Orion abort modes

NASA's newest spacecraft, the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), will be the first American spacecraft since Project Apollo to use an escape system in the event of a launch abort, something its predecessor, the Space Shuttle, had for only its first four orbital test flights in 1981-1982. Like the Apollo Command-Service Module (CSM), the Orion CEV will use the Launch escape system (LES), a solid-fueled tractor rocket that will be able to pull the Orion crew module away from a malfunctioning Space Launch System (SLS) rocket during the initial launch phase. Based on the launch escape system found on the Soviet/Russian Soyuz spacecraft, the LAS, designed and manufactured by ATK for the Orion CEV, will be larger than the Soyuz version and will have more thrust than the Atlas 109-D booster that carried astronaut John Glenn into orbit in 1962.

Title: High water mark

A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges. High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt. It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.

Title: Open information extraction

In natural language processing, open information extraction (OIE) is the task of generating a structured, machine-readable representation of the information in text, usually in the form of triples or n-ary propositions. A proposition can be understood as truth-bearer, a textual expression of a potential fact (e.g., ""Dante wrote the Divine Comedy""), represented in an amenable structure for computers [e.g., (""Dante"", ""wrote"", ""Divine Comedy"")]. An OIE extraction normally consists of a relation and a set of arguments. For instance, (""Dante"", ""passed away in"" ""Ravenna"") is a proposition formed by the relation ""passed away in"" and the arguments ""Dante"" and ""Ravenna"". The first argument is usually referred as the subject while the second is considered to be the object.

This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics, and also earned Wu the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics a mere two decades later in 1978. Her expertise in experimental physics evoked comparisons to Marie Curie. Her nicknames include ""the First Lady of Physics"", ""the Chinese Madame Curie"", and the ""Queen of Nuclear Research"". 

Title: Wu experiment

The Wu experiment was a nuclear physics experiment conducted in 1956 by the Chinese American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu in collaboration with the Low Temperature Group of the US National Bureau of Standards. The experiment's purpose was to establish whether or not conservation of parity (""P""-conservation), which was previously established in the electromagnetic and strong interactions, also applied to weak interactions. If ""P""-conservation were true, a mirrored version of the world (where left is right and right is left) would behave as the mirror image of the current world. If ""P""-conservation were violated, then it would be possible to distinguish between a mirrored version of the world and the mirror image of the current world.

Therefore, theologians might find a dogmatic basis for union between separated churches. Also, the arguments of Catholics could be answered in a polemical way. To Protestants, the fundamental articles are those that Christians must believe to be saved.

Title: Cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics

The cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed by Anthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that applies in the context of eternal cosmological inflation, which arguably predicts an infinite three-dimensional space with infinitely many planets and infinitely many copies of any quantum system. According to this interpretation, the wavefunction for a quantum system describes not some imaginary ensemble of possibilities for what the system might be doing, but rather the actual spatial collection of identical copies of the system that exist in our infinite space. Its collapse can be avoided. Moreover, the quantum uncertainty that you experience simply reflects your inability to self-locate in space, i.e., to know which of your infinitely many copies throughout space is the one having your subjective perceptions.

A wide range of political and social reforms were enacted under his rule, including an end to the international slave trade, which had historically been a key source of wealth and armaments for the Merina monarchy. Through aggressive military campaigns he successfully united two-thirds of the island under his rule. Abuse of alcohol weakened his health and he died prematurely at age 35. He was succeeded by his highest-ranking wife, Ranavalona I.

Title: List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles

The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norse as the ""Suðreyjar"", or ""Southern Isles"" as distinct from the ""Norðreyjar"" or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. The historical record is incomplete and the kingdom was probably not a continuous entity throughout the entire period. The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the ""Kingdom of Mann and the Isles"", although only some of the later rulers claimed that title. At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney. At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory. The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south.

Title: Norman invasion of Wales

The Norman invasion of Wales began shortly after the Norman conquest of England under William the Conqueror, who believed England to be his birthright. Initially (1067–1081), the invasion of Wales was not undertaken with the fervor and purpose of the invasion of England. However, a much stronger Norman invasion began in 1081 and by 1094 most of Wales was under the control of William's eldest son, King William II of England. The Welsh greatly disliked the ""gratuitously cruel"" Normans and by 1101 had regained control of the greater part of their country under the long reign of King Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had been imprisoned by the Normans for twelve years before his escape. Gruffudd had some indirect help from King Magnus III of Norway (Magnus Barefoot) who attacked the Normans briefly off the Isle of Anglesey in northwest Wales near Ynys Seiriol, killing Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury and leaving the Normans depleted and demoralized. Magnus went on to take the Orkney Islands, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Man, islands north of Wales and west and north of Scotland and England, in 1098.

Title: Lou Lombardo (filmmaker)

Lou Lombardo (February 15, 1932 – May 8, 2002) was an American filmmaker whose editing of the 1969 film ""The Wild Bunch"" has been called ""seminal"". In all, Lombardo is credited on more than twenty-five feature films. Noted mainly for his work as a film and television editor, he also worked as a cameraman, director, and producer. In his obituary, Stephen Prince wrote, ""Lou Lombardo's seminal contribution to the history of editing is his work on ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), directed by Sam Peckinpah. The complex montages of violence that Lombardo created for that film influenced generations of filmmakers and established the modern cinematic textbook for editing violent gun battles."" Several critics have remarked on the ""strange, elastic quality"" of time in the film, and have discerned the film's influence in the work of directors John Woo, Quentin Tarantino, Kathryn Bigelow, and the Wachowskis, among others. While Lombardo's collaboration with Peckinpah lasted just a few years, his career was intertwined with that of director Robert Altman for more than thirty years. Lombardo edited Altman's 1971 film ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" (1971), which had ""a radical approach to the use of dialogue and indeed other sound, both in and beyond the frame."" Towards the end of his career Lombardo edited ""Moonstruck"" (1987) and two other films directed by Norman Jewison. While his editing is now considered ""revolutionary"" and ""brilliant"", Lombardo was never nominated for editing awards during his career.

What made this company standout from the others in the district is that it was locally owned and operated agricultural implement business, rather than one owned by a factory from the east. The company went out of business in 1915 and the building was taken over by International Harvester, which owned the building next door. They added the single story brick addition to the south in 1927.

This building was built by the Sandwich Manufacturing Company and the Marseilles Manufacturing Company in what is known as the Implement District, an industrial area south of the central business district that was home to farm implement manufacturers. The two-story section on the north side was completed in 1883, and the single-story addition on the south side was completed sometime between 1889 and 1891. Marseilles then occupied the addition while Sandwich remained in the original building. There was a shift from agricultural implements to food processing as the area's business interests began to diversify. Dwarfies Corporation, a cereal manufacturer, took over the building in 1929. It is the only remaining building left in the city to illustrate this shift. The building was damaged in a fire in 1947.

The bank occupied most of the first floor and some of the office space above, while the other office space was taken up by professional offices. By the 1960s the bank occupied the whole building. John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, John Hamilton and Tommy Carroll robbed the bank on March 13,1934 and stole about $50,000. Dillinger was wounded in an exchange of gunfire during the heist.

Evans, an entrepreneur who had business interests in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota, had this building constructed to house Northwestern National Bank of which he was the president. The bank occupied the main level and other offices were housed on the upper floors. Local architect Charles Brown designed the four-story Romanesque Revival style building. The Black Hills sandstone for the public facades was from Evans' quarry. The Panic of 1893 brought Sioux City's building boom to an end, and the Evans block was sold in January 1895.

Pretty Shield, a Crow author and medicine woman, described her as being wild and attractive, but not having a man. She fought because her brother had recently been killed by the Sioux and she sought revenge against them. Most of the Crow carried rifles, but The Other Magpie carried only her belt knife and her coup stick. She counted coup on a Sioux warrior and eventually killed and scalped him. The scalp that she took was one of only eleven taken in the battle. Pretty Shield described her as having tied a feather on the end of her coup stick to symbolize her achievement. Later, she cut the scalp into pieces and gave them to the male warriors so they would have more scalps for the dance after the battle.

5a8eed625542995085b374b9,Which system of parliament was modeled after the United Kingdom and is also used in Canada? ,Westminster system,bridge,hard,"{'title': ['Constitution of Alberta', 'Constitution of Alberta', 'Westminster system'], 'sent_id': [0, 1, 0]}","Title: Governance of England

There has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland. The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure. This situation has led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) are able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs can not vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution. In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed. 

Title: Constitution of Alberta

The Constitution of Alberta describes the fundamental rules under which the Canadian province of Alberta is governed. As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution. Alberta's constitution, like Britain's (on which it is modeled), includes any and all pieces of legislation, court decisions, proclamations, and conventions which together inform how the province operates. Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list. The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned that this was not a ""definitive list"". However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada. 

Title: Australian Public Service

The Australian Public Service (APS) is the federal civil service of the Commonwealth of Australia responsible for the public administration, public policy, and public services of the departments and executive and statutory agencies of the Government of Australia. The Australian Public Service was established at the Federation of Australia in 1901 as the Commonwealth Public Service and modeled on the Westminster system and United Kingdom's Civil Service. The establishment and operation of the Australian Public Service is governed by the ""Public Service Act 1999"" of the Parliament of Australia as an ""apolitical public service that is efficient and effective in serving the Government, the Parliament and the Australian public"". The conduct of Australian public servants is also governed by a Code of Conduct and guided by the APS Values set by the Australian Public Service Commission. 

Title: Irish measure

Irish measure or plantation measure was a system of units of land measurement used in Ireland from the 16th century plantations until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century. The units were based on ""English measure"" but used a linear perch measuring 7 yard as opposed to the English rod of 5.5 yard . Thus, linear units such as the furlong and mile, which were defined in terms of perches, were longer by a factor of 14:11 (~27% more) in Irish measure, while areas such as the rood or acre were larger by 196:121 (~62% more). After the Act of Union 1800, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, whose Parliament passed the Weights and Measures Act 1824, which established English measure in Ireland as ""Imperial measure"" or ""statute measure"". Imperial measure soon replaced Irish measure in the use of the Dublin Castle administration, but Irish measure persisted in local government, and longer still in private use. A third system, ""Scotch measure"" or ""Cunningham measure"", was also used in Ulster Scots areas. 

Title: Atlantis Music Prize

The Atlantis Music Prize is a music award annually given to the best full-length album from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, based only on artistic merit, regardless of genre, sales or record label. The award, established in 2008 by St. John's-based alternative newspaper ""The Scope"", includes a certificate prize of $1000. The award is modeled after the Polaris Music Prize for all of Canada (which in turn is modeled after the Mercury Music Prize in the United Kingdom). 

Title: Canada under British rule

Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire. Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas. With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada. Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation. Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949. Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom. 

Title: General Assembly House

The General Assembly House, colloquially called Shedifice by the members of parliament, was the first house of the New Zealand Parliament in Auckland. It was in use by Parliament from 1854 until 1864 during the time that Auckland was the capital of New Zealand. It was also used by the Auckland Provincial Council, with Auckland Province owning the building from 1858. After the abolition of the provincial government system, the building was used by government's survey department and was then used by Auckland University College. The General Assembly House was demolished in 1917 to make way for Anzac Avenue. Today, a reserve adjacent to Parliament Street commemorates the location where New Zealand Parliament met initially. 

Title: Politics of Canada

The politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions. Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the Monarch is head of state. The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament. However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs). Such members, in the government caucus, and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National-Defence Committee. 

Title: Westminster system

The Westminster system is a parliamentary system of government modelled after that which developed in the United Kingdom. This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British parliament. 

Title: British North America Acts

The British North America Acts 1867–1975 are the original names of a series of Acts at the core of the constitution of Canada. They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada. In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982. The rest were renamed in Canada as the ""Constitution Acts"". In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names. The term ""British North America"" (BNA) refers to the British colonies in North America.

Title: Wanshan Archipelago Campaign

The Wanshan Archipelago Campaign (万山群岛战役) was a campaign fought between the communist and the nationalist forces during the Chinese Civil War for the control of Wanshan Archipelago (""Wanshan Qundao"", 万山群岛), and resulted in communist victory.

German (""Deutsch"" ] ) is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg. The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English. 

Title: English language

English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global ""lingua franca"". Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, particularly French. 

Title: Proto-Norse language

Proto-Norse (also called Proto-Scandinavian, Primitive Norse, Proto-Nordic, Ancient Nordic, Ancient Scandinavian, Old Nordic, Old Scandinavian, Proto-North Germanic, North Proto-Germanic or Common Scandinavian) was an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia that is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic in the first centuries CE. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken around from the 2nd to 8th centuries (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age). It evolved into the dialects of Old Norse at the beginning of the Viking Age in about 800, which later themselves evolved into modern North Germanic languages. 

Title: Dutch language

Dutch (   ) is a West Germanic language that is spoken by around 24 million people as a first language—including the population of the Netherlands and about sixty percent that of Belgium—and by another 5 million as a second language. It is the third most widely spoken Germanic language, after English and German. 

Title: Old Frisian

Old Frisian is a West Germanic language spoken between the 8th and 16th centuries in the area between the Rhine and Weser on the European North Sea coast. The Frisian settlers on the coast of South Jutland (today's Northern Friesland) also spoke Old Frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known. The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the Zuiderzee and Ems River (the Frisians mentioned by Tacitus) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. 

Title: Afrikaans

Afrikaans ( ) is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia and, to a lesser extent, Botswana and Zimbabwe. It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century. Hence, it is a daughter language of Dutch, and was previously referred to as ""Cape Dutch"" (a term also used to refer collectively to the early Cape settlers) or ""kitchen Dutch"" (a derogatory term used to refer to Afrikaans in its earlier days). However, it is also variously described as a creole or as a partially creolised language. The term is ultimately derived from Dutch ""Afrikaans-Hollands "" meaning ""African Dutch"". It is the first language of most of the Afrikaners and Coloureds of Southern Africa.

The road over the dam is normally open for hikers (not cars) and makes for a possible route into the northern parts of Sarek National Park which does not require using a boat. 

Title: Old Saxon

Old Saxon, also known as Old Low German, was a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German (spoken nowadays in Northern Germany, the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the Americas and parts of Eastern Europe). It is a West Germanic language, closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages. It has been documented from the 8th century until the 12th century, when it gradually evolved into Middle Low German. It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony. It partially shares Anglo-Frisian's (Old Frisian, Old English) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages, such as Dutch, Luxembourgish and German. 

Title: Leda (river)

The Leda is a river in north-western Germany in the state of Lower Saxony. It is a right tributary of the Ems and originates at the confluence of the Sagter Ems and the Soeste (Dreyschloot) near the town of Barßel. The Leda flows into the Ems near the town of Leer. On the southern bank of the Leda, in the ""Overledingen Land"" (Overledingen=""country over the Leda""), opposite Leer, lies the small settlement of Kloster Muhde (""Muhde"" from the Old Frisian ""mutha"" meaning ""(river) mouth"").
