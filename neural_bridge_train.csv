Split testing, or A/B testing as it is often called, is one of the most effective ways to increase the performance of your various marketing campaigns and ultimately your entire sales funnel. You can run an A/B test to measure the performance of many different parts of your sales funnel, including your email campaigns, landing pages, ad campaigns and more. And a few hours of work could lead to big boosts in conversions, revenue, and more.
You can use split-testing to optimize your sales funnel.
So what is split testing anyways? Basically, you will test two or more different versions of your campaign or asset. Let’s say you want to A/B test your landing page. You might set up one landing page with a call-to-action (CTA) that says “Click here to learn how to increase your ecommerce sales!” and another CTA that states “Click Here to Enjoy a Free Trial!” then measure which one performs better.
Ideally, when you A/B test something, you change only one thing between the two versions. So when split testing the call to action, you won’t change around images, buttons, or anything else. Your goal is to determine exactly what is causing performance to increase (or decrease).
Example of a simple A/B test. Notice the different click buttons.
If you change multiple elements at once, it’ll be hard (if not impossible) to determine which one is causing the change. By testing only one thing at a time, you can hone in on changes that are making a difference.
However, in order to determine whether something is having an impact or not, you need to gather a lot of data. We’re not talking about dozens of clicks, but instead thousands or even tens of thousands. If you test every individual word change and element individually, it can be difficult to collect enough data.
Let’s say you want to try a new CTA and you want to know the impact of this CTA and button throughout your entire sales funnel. You can do this with a multi-page A/B test. You will simply apply the new CTA at every relevant stage of your funnel.
The orange “Get Started for Free” button is an example of a CTA from PayKickstart’s site.
Most sales funnels feature multiple pages, and most pages will offer you an opportunity to use your CTA. You can set up two funnels, one with the old CTA, another with the new CTA, and then test the performance of each sales funnel on the whole.
Customers are going to progress through each phase of your funnel. You can split test different steps of this funnel to see how each step is performing. For example, you could test one version of a landing page. Then when the customer clicks on the first link and goes to the product info page, you can A/B test that product info page as well.
Next, the customer might check out with the product. Here again, you can A/B test the shopping cart to see what features, tools, or language is working best. In this case, a single customer interaction allows you to test multiple things at once. However, since you are A/B testing individual pages against one another, you can still hone in on what is producing results and what’s not.
If you’re thinking about a huge shake-up, say changing your entire marketing language or the overall feel of your brand, testing simply a logo change or a call-to-action might not be enough. Instead, you can A/B test your entire approach to see if the radical shake-up will produce results.
So if you design a whole new website with a more modern look and more aggressive copy, you could A/B test that against your old website. If results are negative, your branding shift might not work. In this case, you may want to try to hone in on what’s causing the drop in performance.
Check out the redesigns to Yahoo!’s homepage. It’d be hard to test each individual element.
So maybe you go back and adjust your calls-to-action to make them less aggressive. At the same time, you could test your new, modern looking website with less aggressive language. If the results are positive and you start producing more conversions, now you have good reason to believe that the updated website is a boon but the aggressive language is not.
Want to test a number of variables at once? It is possible, especially if you have a lot of traffic. Keep in mind that the testing itself might not be quite as accurate as A/B testing a single variable. However, let’s be honest, if you want to test a large number of individual variables, you may not have enough time to A/B test every single one.
IMDb changed a lot of elements in the two above websites. It would take a long time to test each variable separately.
With multivariate testing, you can swap a number of variables. The trick is to test every possible combination to see which ones work best and which ones are performing worse. If you have a common element turns up in your lowest performing ones, say a certain purchase button or CTA, you can take an educated guess and surmise that the specific element is lowering performance.
Likewise, if certain elements turn up consistently in your best-performing variations, there’s a good chance that these elements are improving performance. You can hone down your tests, dropping the worst performing combinations and elements until you end up with your best performing combination of variables.
Split Testing takes commitment. You’re going to need to test a considerable amount of traffic to gather enough data to uncover meaningful insights. And a proper split testing campaign can take weeks, if not months to complete.
This is especially true if you want to test a variety of elements. Still, the payoff will ultimately worth it. Using data, you should be able to increase your sales and conversions.",What is the purpose of split testing in marketing campaigns?,"The purpose of split testing in marketing campaigns is to increase the performance of various marketing campaigns and the entire sales funnel. It involves testing two or more different versions of a campaign or asset to determine what changes lead to an increase or decrease in performance. This can lead to big boosts in conversions, revenue, and more."
"Asia's major oil consuming nations have decided to release crude oil from their respective strategic petroleum reserves in coordinated efforts with the US to ease the price burden on Asia Pacific consumers, but some of the top Asian economies believe there are more effective ways to tame consumer inflation such as lowering fuel taxes.

India, China, South Korea and Japan said they plan to release their state oil reserves after the White House announced Nov. 23 that the US will release 50 million barrels from its SPR early next year.
India has agreed to release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its SPR, while China is poised to release more crude from state reserves amid expectations that the second set of auctions could potentially include at least 7 million barrels of medium sweet ESPO blend crude.
South Korea will release crude from its SPR, with a source at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy indicating that Seoul could offer about 3.8 million barrels.
Japan will also sell part of the country's national petroleum reserves. Tokyo's sales of national petroleum reserves will be made by advancing its planned sales of crude oil grades for replacement in the national petroleum reserves without violating the country's petroleum stockpiling law. The sales could amount to around ""a couple of hundred thousand kiloliters,"" according to Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda.
However, the volume of the major Asian economies' SPR releases disappointed global market participants, while New Delhi, Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo and have all failed to provide any timeline for their crude releases so far.
""Asia's SPR release was below expectations and it is [even understood to be] an exchange deal... buyers need to return the oil in 2022 to 2024,"" a crude trader based in Singapore said.
The combined total of the four nations' crude releases account for only a tiny portion of their SPRs. Many Asian nations are not exactly keen on fully utilizing national reserves, with state-run oil companies and major private refiners in Northeast and Southeast Asia indicating that the true purpose of the SPR is for critical events such as drastic supply disruptions due to major geopolitical events like war, not for commercial reasons like high prices.
In addition, quality concerns could limit demand from Japanese refiners as a large quantity of crude oil in Japan's SPR has been sealed in the same tanks for more than decades, according to refinery and trading sources with close knowledge of the matter.
Tax cuts, subsidies
Authorities in South Korea and Japan are seeking to implement more constructive ways to tackle the rising consumer inflation and help ease the burden on consumers struggling with high retail fuel prices.
Earlier this month, South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance decided to lower taxes on auto fuels by as much as 20% for six months from November, as part of efforts to ease rise in pump prices.
In Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry decided to provide subsidies to curb increases in retail prices of gasoline, kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil from the end of December to end of March in an effort to aid domestic transportation fuel consumers.
Tax cuts and subsidies can effectively and promptly bring prices down for consumers, but it takes months for the big international benchmark price moves to be fully reflected in daily life for the average citizen and retail gas stations, according to middle distillate marketers at Japan's Cosmo Oil and South Korea's S-Oil Corp.
OPEC+ hike, not cut
Oil industry and refinery sources across Asia indicated that although OPEC and its allies are adopting a cautious approach in the group's production strategy, the producers are still raising production, albeit at a slower-than-desired rate.
OPEC and its allies are standing firm on increasing crude output quotas by a modest 400,000 b/d each month. In contrast, nine major Asian refiners surveyed by S&P Global Platts -- including PTT, BPCL, ENEOS, SK Innovation, Petronas and PetroChina -- indicated the producer group should ideally raise supply by at least 800,000 b/d as current oil prices appear too high and consumer sentiment is hurt by prices at these levels.
However, the current market fundamentals are far from what Asian oil and refining industry would classify as a 'state emergency' as the OPEC+ is still looking to raise output and the group is not actually reducing supply, according to trading managers and plant operation managers at the major Asian refiners surveyed.",What measures are being taken by major Asian economies to ease the price burden on Asia Pacific consumers due to high oil prices?,"Major Asian economies like India, China, South Korea, and Japan have decided to release crude oil from their strategic petroleum reserves in coordination with the US. Additionally, South Korea and Japan are implementing measures like lowering fuel taxes, providing subsidies, and reducing taxes on auto fuels to tackle rising consumer inflation and high retail fuel prices."

We don't see very many films or dramas on the history channel here in Britain . I know the American version shows them because American reviewers have mentioned this on this very website , but I'm not very keen on this happening over here because before you know it we might be seeing THE GREEN BERETS , BRAVEHEART and WE WERE SOLDIERS appearing on the channel , poor movies and poor history to boot in my opinion . At the weekend we were treated to BREAKER MORANT . As I said I'm not keen on the history channel transmitting feature films but I'll forgive them this time because it's a very good movie and very good history .
BREAKER MORANT is the dramatisation of a real life incident during the Boer war , the first "" dirty war "" of the 20th century , where three Australian officers Harry Morant , John Handcock and George Witton are on trial for their lives for the murder of boer POWs and of a German missionary . What I love about this film is that unlike a lot of other movies with an anti-war / anti- military injustice agenda is that it shows the difficult situations soldiers will always find themselves in . The men on trial are victims , victims of politics and of a wider picture . With the killing of the missionary Germany wants to intervene in the conflict on the side of the boers , not to protect the noble South African farmers from British aggression but to get their hands on the region's gold and diamond mines . In order to stop this happening the British government needs scapegoats in order to hang and Morant , Witton and Handcock were to be hung out to dry so it's the politicians of the time who are to blame for this miscarriage of justice , not the military , and it'd be interesting to note what people who campaign for pardons for the British soldiers shot for "" cowardice "" during the first world war make of this tale . The three characters on trial here are victims of a grave injustice but you can't help feeling because they "" were only obeying orders "" sympathy for them will be in short supply from a modern day perspective . I'm probably correct in saying that anyone who's served in the military can see far more clearly the injustice done than any of the "" professional anti-war brigade "" . BREAKER MORANT isn't a movie than can be used for anyone's hidden agenda , and for that we should be grateful
It's fairly obvious BREAKER MORANT is based upon a stage play . The central setting is a military court room with much of the story told in flashback . Director Bruce Beresford handles the action scenes very well but in this type of story the most important aspect is the cast and their acting , and the director gets the best out of his cast especially Edward Woodward ( Normally an actor I don't like ) who gives a career best performance and Jack Thompson . My only criticism of the casting is that a couple of actors playing British characters let their Aussie accents slip a little , but I'm nitpicking .
Just to sum up this is a very intelligent story of a dirty war , dirty politics and dirty justice which will appeal to serious historians and former servicemen rather than professional pacifists","What is the central setting of the movie ""BREAKER MORANT""?",The central setting is a military court room with much of the story told in flashback.
"9th Circuit judge urges settlement in campus-speech case
TUCSON, Ariz. — Arizona State University and an anti-abortion student group should consider settling a three-year legal battle over a campus free-speech issue, a federal judge said this week.
ASU Students for Life’s 2006 lawsuit argued that the university discriminated against students by imposing an insurance requirement for on-campus events. The university has since implemented and modified a written policy that loosens the requirements.
“It sounds like you have achieved a victory,” Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, told Heather Gebelin Hacker, an Alliance Defense Fund attorney representing the student group.
But Hacker said during arguments Oct. 20 at the University of Arizona law college that there’s no certainty that the university won’t change its policies again without a court ruling in favor of protection of free speech on campus. The trial court ruling being appealed went in favor of the university, Hacker noted.
“This case is really about the principle,” she said, adding that students need “a bright-line rule.”
Michael Goodwin, an assistant attorney general representing the university, said the lawsuit still is seeking nominal damages from two university officials in connection with enforcement of the policy.
Goodwin assured the court that the university would not revert to its previous policy, but Hacker said that assurance didn’t have the force of law.
“Oh, come on,” replied one of the judges, retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.
A desire by the plaintiffs to be awarded attorneys fees also could be at play, Goodwin said in response to a question by Kozinski.
The judge said he’d rather not have to rule on the constitutionality of a policy that no longer is in use.
During a question-and-answer period following arguments on the ASU case and another, Kozinski said he regularly urges lawyers to try to have their clients settle cases.
That can be better than taking the risk involved in having the court decide the outcome and achieve a result more in line with the parties’ goals, he said.
“I always consider it a victory when the parties wind up settling,” he said.
While sometimes litigation can’t be avoided, a different type of resolution “may preserve that resolution that lets them go forward on a positive note,” he said.

"Long-time market bull Ed Yardeni is delivering a dose of optimism into year-end.
Yardeni, who’s known for running investment strategy for Prudential and Deutsche Bank, expects the holidays to boost stocks deeper into record territory.
“This is going to be one of the best Christmas seasons ever,” the president of Yardeni Research told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “People are coming out of this pandemic still mentally, and they need to spend. And, I think they realize they have to spend now because if you get too close to Christmas, a lot of the merchandise may be out of stock.”
He expects a willingness to spend despite the inflation spike.
“Consumer confidence has been weak, and inflation has been eating into the wage gains,” said Yardeni. “But the reality is some of the lowest income workers in America are seeing some of the best wage increases they’ve had maybe ever.”
He speculates higher income workers with robust savings are adding to consumers’ capacity to offset inflation pressures.
Yardeni’s base case is stocks will continue to rise, and price pressures will ease once supply chain troubles get worked out
“Companies are doing a great job of hammering away and getting at costs and keeping profit margins at all-time record highs,” he said. “It’s very, very impressive.”
The Dow, S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq closed the week at record highs. The S&P 500 is at 4,697.53, up 25% so far this year. It’s also 2% away from Yardeni’s year-end target.
‘The market is moving pretty quick here’
“I have a 4,800 for the S&P 500 by the end of this year or the end of next week. I’m working on the timing. The market is moving pretty quick here, and then 5,200 by the end of next year,” said Yardeni, who’s also author of the new book “In Praise of Profits!.”
Yardeni’s latest positivity comes 17 months after his “ray of sunshine” market call on “Trading Nation.” In the midst of Covid-19 lockdowns in Spring 2020, he predicted a “pretty broad bull market” was ahead.
Now, he suggests the biggest hardships associated with the pandemic are behind the United States.
“Enough people have been vaccinated that the economy is performing just fine. It’s really not seeing that the pandemic is getting in the way of economic growth,” said Yardeni. “It’s probably another reason why we’re having yet another move to record highs in the market.”
Yardeni continues to recommend overweighting stocks. Over the next 12 months, he likes the value mid and small cap stocks offer to investors. He also lists technology, financials and energy as his top picks within the S&P 500.
“We’re looking at a continuation of the bull market,” Yardeni said.",What is Ed Yardeni's prediction for the S&P 500 by the end of next year?,"Ed Yardeni predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 5,200 by the end of next year."
"I'm sporting a frizzy Betty Page wig and breathing heavily. I've never been on skate skis before, and now I'm trying it in a 24-hour race with itchy wig hair in my eyes—but that's no excuse. The pack from a mass start at the Equinox Ski Challenge in West Yellowstone is starting to break up, and I'm already falling behind. Hell, I should be able to ski faster than I walk.
Or maybe not. Just 10 minutes into the 5.4-mile course on the Rendezvous Ski Trails I'm dead last, sliding bow-legged in search of a rhythm that will bring me a bit of momentum. It doesn't come, and by the half-hour mark I'm lapped by one racer after another—men, women, children—until it feels like I'm again among the pack just as I approach a big hill. The others cruise up from behind and tuck into a long, steep right-hand drop leading back toward the timing gate and warming hut.
I join them, confident at first in a clumsy tuck. I grew up downhill skiing. This shouldn't be a problem. But then as the track flattens out again my tuck collapses into a yard sale barrel roll. A woman wearing butterfly wings looks back and says, ""That sounded like carnage."" It feels like it, too. I collect my breath and poles and wig, and launch into a hobble. All I want to do is complete one lap and tag my wife, who will carry on for our team.
It's not that I hope to win this thing—not when some of the 88 contestants pass by me like superheros with facial hair. Three of the early front-runners in the men's division are bearded, and one is decked out in a Lycra suit that appears to be vintage 1980s. The man in this midnight-blue and flame-orange body sock is a lean and agile, late 40-something athlete. He's a bit older than me, and clearly 10 times faster.
The hirsute pack leaders will lap me three times before I make it back to race HQ and take a long break. I'll spend the next 22 hours watching them rack up more than 150 miles of nearly non-stop kicking and gliding around the Equinox course. These guys will average more than six miles an hour and cover ground equivalent to a round-trip between Missoula and Polson while I'll struggle to make a measly few laps. I have no place in what will become the battle of the ice beards.
Still, I feel right at home. The Equinox Ski Challenge is a celebration of community, great snow and lactic acid. It's a tiny frozen Mardi Gras, and it's entirely up to each one of us to decide when it's time to pass out.
Around late March when the sunny side of the calendar officially begins and the ski season starts its downward slide into spring, it's time to break out the wigs, costumes and race-worthy Nordic wear in West Yellowstone. Since 2007, the town by the eponymous park has been the site of the Equinox Ski Challenge, an annual charity race where racers finish as many laps as possible in three hours, six hours, 12 hours or, in the case of my wife and I, the 24-hour coup de grâce.
Funny outfits are optional, although it's part of the tradition. Going long distances is optional, too: No one is required to complete a set number of laps on the rolling course through a dense pine forest. Besides the hill where I crashed, the route is mostly a series of serene ups and downs over a deep snow base.
The combo start-and-finish line sits near a local street, with a nearby hotel and places to eat, ringed by competitors' tents and tech shelters for ski tune-ups and waxing. I cross it for the first time at lunchtime, after two hours of sweaty, clumsy huffing. Other racers are starting to lose track of the number of laps they've logged. But after just one go-around, I'm ready for a break.
There at the finish line, thankfully, is my wife, Katie. She's wearing a shiny bridesmaid's dress and is laughing at me.
""What took you so long?"" she asks. I tag her and send her off with a ""you'll see"" and a kiss, then head for the warming hut.
Inside it is Dan Cantrell, who lives in Big Sky and comes down to West Yellowstone to ski. He grew up on a cross-country ski course in Vermont, and some youthful enthusiasm left over from those years led him to volunteer as this year's race organizer. Cantrell took over from a National Outdoor Leadership School instructor named Sam Newbury, who dreamed up the idea of the challenge in 2006 while driving home from the 24 Hours of Moab mountain bike race.
""The Equinox Ski Challenge is such a uniquely focused race,"" Cantrell explains. ""It's not all about competition, but instead, personal challenge and commitment.""
The coziness of the hut helps me forge a deep commitment to sitting down. Next to me are Leila Sternman and Aaron Sinnard, a pair of 20-somethings from Bozeman. Sternman is eating a calorie-packed concoction made of peanut butter, pasta and soy sauce.
""I'm a little nervous my muscles will seize up,"" she says, motioning to the brown mush she's eating. ""I'm working hard on electrolytes...and peanut butter.""
When I tell them I'm happy to be only sore and not injured from my fall, Sinnard says, ""I was coming up the hill behind you guys. You were talking or something, going real slow. And I was thinking, 'Wow, someone is actually slower than me.' I was barely moving. The craziest thing was how packed in we were and no one crashed into you. That was special. That was a good crash. Might be the best one here.""
We laugh about me leaving a ""man-shaped hole"" in the course, then Sternman assures me that experiences and stories like mine are the real prize at events like the Equinox Challenge.
""It's, you know, type-two fun,"" she says. ""It's not fun while you're doing it, but later you look back on it and say, 'Oh that was really fun. Remember that night when it was freezing and horrible?' That's type-two. And if you're lucky it's a mega moon tonight.""

"Boz Scaggs' musical career stretches back to his 1960s prep school days in a band with Steve Miller.
Dozens of albums later - including his latest, ""Dig"" - something growls within the soft-spoken Scaggs to keep making music.
""I'm still looking to get that one or two songs right,"" he said during a phone interview. ""There's still a voice inside of me that keeps trying to write 'that' song.""
The soul-searching singer-guitarist will bring his unique R&B/jazz blend to the Mid-State Fair at 7:30 p.m. Aug. 2, part of An Evening of Music and Wine.
The fair scene is new to Scaggs, which prompts some apprehension, but he's comfortable in the wine-and-tunes setting.
""I've played wineries in the Bay Area and Washington state. The audiences are great; they're comfortable. ... Wine and music have always gone hand in hand,"" he said.
The show will reflect Scaggs' current fascination with the standard jazz style. Although most of his songs hang on recognizable riffs and hooks, he's ready to improvise a bit.
""The jazz style is entirely improvised every night. ... I'm going to try some of that; it's part of what I'm looking for this time out,"" he said.
Scaggs has dabbled in a melting pot of styles over the years. He played in blues bands with Miller, his college buddy, and later helped launch the psychedelic Steve Miller Band in 1967. After a couple albums, he opted for a solo career, which he's been refining ever since.
Scaggs broke into commercial success with the single ""Lowdown"" from the ""Silk Degrees"" release in '76 and the song ""Love, Look What You've Done to Me"" from the film ""Urban Cowboy."" He slipped into retirement for most of the '80s. Now, Scaggs makes and performs music on his own time.
""Mostly I'm in work mode these days with several projects. ... I'd rather be really busy than kind of busy, or really away from it,"" he said.
Scaggs' projects include recording demos with a jazz quartet and studying the standards.
His occasional performance lets him test that studio work.
""There's no connection with the audience while I'm recording,"" he said. ""When I'm doing a show, I'm getting to try out those words on the outside. I'm wondering as I sing how they're connecting and finding a different nuance in those words than when I was sitting alone at my desk writing them.""
At 58, Scaggs is still discovering what works and what draws emotions from listeners. ""Every once in a while, I've happened on an original point of view, and it's very satisfying,"" Scaggs said. ""That's why most of us do what we do - we get a sensation, and we want to find it again and again.""",What is Boz Scaggs' current fascination in music style?,Boz Scaggs' current fascination is with the standard jazz style.

"With your natal Mars in Libra, this tender and balanced Air sign will blur most sharp sides of the red planet. This placement prompts it to function in balanced ways even if those are incompatible with Martian power. Libra may be neutralizing the strong drive that Mars usually offers, yet on the other hand will gift such a native with the ability to avoid quarrels of any type and handle all situations with diplomacy. Mars in Libra can be very helpful for people whose target is a stable marriage and that invest in creating the right conditions for a happy merged reality with their significant Libra, Mars is in detriment and thus in its lowest potency. Libra is located directly opposite of the sign of Aries, where Mars is considered domicile as it is the sign that he rules. This is a rather impractical placement to have in a natal chart, as it will diminish all impulsive reactions that the red planet usually creates. Such people become overly discreet, polite and fair; as a result they might not even react when someone else mistreats them, raises his tone or even become aggressive. They will even absorb all that negativity just to calm things down, while at the same time hold inside them any sharp feelings of their own – to not throw more gas in the fire. Libra is ruling the seventh house, which is responsible for business partnerships, marriages, contracts and all types of merging reality with another person. With Mars placed here, all these life patterns become very important; the native may be even sacrifice a lot of his ego to preserve such relations in a good condition..
Natal Mars in Libra is great for people who need a life without a lot of turmoil, and prefer long-lasting harmony and stability. They will fight for it, yet through absorbing Martian energy rather than radiating it. They are willing to be patient when their partner’s Mars is having explosive moments, and by receiving those “punches” without retaliating, they are somehow becoming a catalyst for expulsion of aggression from the couple as whole. Indeed, this is not an easy job to do, as it requires delicate handling and a lot of strength to not get hurt. Yet, such people consider their relationships as an utmost goal and will do anything to preserve them. This will make them the real heroes, as sometimes avoiding battles and being calm in difficult situations is even more difficult than entering a duel and winning it.
An important characteristic that this placement creates is indecisiveness, especially when someone needs to act quickly. The Mars in Libra native cannot decide well under pressure, because he needs time to weight the possible options and their outcome; in addition he has the tendency to check what effect any decision will have on other people too. Thus, when he needs to choose quickly, some sort of black-out may happen and blur his mind. In such situations a Libra Mars may either let other people decide and hold a passive position, or let life and circumstances decide themselves. Stalling over choosing may actually seem the most attractive option that they can have!
A quite natural technique that Mars in Libra people use during confrontations is a passive-aggressive approach. As they do not feel comfortable opposing other people directly, this is usually their weapon of choice when they want to impose their own rules. Yet, because they usually fight for the sake of both themselves and the other person (actually for the harmony of the relation between them), passive-aggressive behavior cannot be considered some cunning way of dominating the other individual. It actually becomes a necessary tool to impose the right balance, or else the Mars in Libra native will just submit to the strong will of the other individual and no harmony will ever be reached. In addition, the polite and fair traits that such people have will even give a charming approach to the usage of this tool. Thus, other individuals will willingly find some golden middle point where agreements can be reached. After all, who can say no to puppy eyes? Especially if those eyes keep their sweetness after sorting out the dispute, and are not used cunningly only for the sake of passing their own agenda.
In case that the native’s Mars in Libra is adversely aspected, especially by malefic, such a native may become a manipulator and use his charm in order to gain things rather than for necessary diplomacy. This can be particularly observed in natal charts of women, where Mars is playing a secondary role. They clearly do not need aggressive masculine energy to drive them through life, and they use the lack of it (due to Libra’s detriment) as a tool for manipulating people who have excessive Martian power. Such women are usually overly feminine, which may make them overly attractive to men with a strong Mars, and they may even end up playing “victim mind games” in order to gain what they want. These darker traits usually are awakened when their Mars is in tough aspects with Pluto, Neptune or Lilith, and all their strategy may look like some clandestine operation of secret services.
When someone has his natal Mars in Libra, he may be very active in the fields of arts, and it is generally considered a good placement for jobs connected not only with creating art but also promoting it. People who have Mars placed here may excel in public relations for artists, selling pieces of art or even managing them, as they seem to find the right ways to blend and bond people of arts with people of business. In case the individual is an artist himself, his own presence and charm may attract a lot of fans, and they can easily find individuals who will finance them. As Libra is ruling the 7th house, it is not uncommon to turn someone who finances their art into a lover – with the prospect of even getting into a deep relationship and bonding deeply. And indeed, Libra Mars people are in need of not being alone; with their significant other being a stable stepping-stone for success and prosperity.
When Mars in Libra is well aspected in a natal chart, the native will be very active in the life area that the sign of Libra Libra,
With Mars at 29°48′ Libra, would it be considered as still being in Libra, or already being in Scorpio?
Many thanks.",What are some characteristics of individuals with their natal Mars in Libra?,"Individuals with their natal Mars in Libra tend to function in balanced ways, avoiding quarrels and handling situations with diplomacy. They may be overly discreet, polite, and fair, often not reacting even when mistreated. They value their relationships highly and are willing to absorb negativity to maintain harmony. However, they can be indecisive, especially under pressure, and may resort to a passive-aggressive approach during confrontations. They may also be very active in the fields of arts."

IN RE: VITAMINS ANTITRUST LITIGATION THIS DOCUMENT RELATES TO: KELLOGG CO.v.F. HOFFMAN LA ROCHE LTD. ET AL.
The opinion of the court was delivered by: Thomas Hogan, Chief Judge, District.
MEMORANDUM OPINION
RE: Plaintiff Kellogg Company's Motion in Limine to Preclude the Evidence that Kellogg Passed on Any Indirect-Purchaser Overcharges
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff Kellogg Company's (""Kellogg"") Motion in Limnine to exclude all evidence pertaining to any purported downstream pass through of defendants' conspiratorial overcharges as irrelevant under the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act. Kellogg claims that evidence of any purported pass through of overcharges is irrelevant under the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act as it is neither an affirmative defense nor an element of the plaintiff's damages claim. The remaining defendants in this action, Lonza and Degussa, oppose Kellogg's motion. Upon careful consideration of the motion, opposition, reply and oral arguments, the Court will deny Kellogg's motion as evidence of a pass through of overcharges may be relevant to defendants' argument that Kellogg did not suffer ""actual damages"" as required under Michigan antitrust law. The Court will not require that Kellogg prove a lack of downstream pass through as an element of its damages claims.
I. BACKGROUND
In this action Kellogg has alleged a massive, long-running international conspiracy among defendants and their co-conspirators to artificially inflate the prices of certain vitamins and vitamin products, allocate shares of the vitamin market among the defendants and their co-conspirators, predetermine sales volume in the vitamin industry, eliminate competition, limit supply, and commit other practices constituting violations of both federal antitrust laws (Kellogg's direct purchaser claims) and the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act (MARA), Mich. Comp. Laws § 445.771 et seq (Kellogg's indirect purchaser claims).
The instant motion in limine concerns only Kellogg's indirect purchaser or ""passon"" claims under state law. Specifically, the motion requires the Court to determine whether, as Kellogg argues, evidence that Kellogg passed-on its indirect purchaser overcharges is irrelevant under the MARA, or whether the MARA allows for a pass through defense.
In order to succeed on the indirect claims under the MARA, plaintiffs must prove at trial that defendants charged higher prices to its direct purchasers than it would have in a competitive environment and that the overcharge or some portion thereof was passed through the chain of distribution to indirect purchasers. See A&M Supply Co. v. Microsoft Corp., 252 Mich. App. 580, 654 N.W.2d 572, 584 (2002).
The relevant Michigan law is intertwined with important federal precedent concerning antitrust suits by private plaintiffs. Therefore, it is appropriately viewed through the backdrop of the landmark Supreme Court cases of Hanover Shoe, Illinois Brick, and ARC America Corp. In Hanover Shoe, the Supreme Court barred antitrust defendants from using the pass through defense except in limited circumstances. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 494, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968). Thus, direct purchaser defendants cannot limit their liability by showing that direct purchaser plaintiffs were not injured and had no damage claim because they passed on the price increase they sustained to indirect purchasers. Id. In Illinois Brick, the Supreme Court addressed the other side of the same coin, specifically, whether an indirect purchaser may offensively use a pass-on theory to show antitrust injury in a federal antitrust claim, despite the fact that a pass-on theory may not be used defensively. Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 726, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). The Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that only direct purchasers have standing to assert antitrust injury for the purposes of Section 4 of the Clayton Act. See id. at 728-29, 97 S.Ct. 2061. Thus, it is clear that generally only direct purchasers can recover under federal antitrust law and that no pass through defense exists under federal antitrust law.
Illinois Brick, however, did not foreclose states from allowing indirect purchaser actions. Nineteen states, including Michigan, and the District of Columbia passed (or already had in place) Illinois Brick repealer statutes that permitted indirect purchasers to collect damages in private antitrust lawsuits. Pl.'s Mem. at 3. In California v. ARC Am. Corp., the Supreme Court upheld these repealer statutes, finding that Congress chose not to apply its Supremacy Clause power to preempt the statutes, and that the statutes did not conflict with federal law. California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 101, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86 (1989).
The Michigan Legislature passed an Illinois Brick repealer statute in 1984 when it enacted MARA subsection 8(2) which states:.
Mich. Comp. Law § 445.778(2).
The statute is silent as to whether a pass through defense is permissible. Kellogg claims that it is not and that all evidence concerning whether Kellogg passed on the overcharges should be precluded. Defendants argue that the MARA permits the recovery of ""actual damages"" only and, therefore, that Kellogg must affirmatively show the amount of actual loss suffered not including any portion of the overcharge passed on in the chain of distribution. This is an issue of first impression,",What is Kellogg Company's argument in its Motion in Limine in the case against F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd. and others?,Kellogg Company's argument in its Motion in Limine is to exclude all evidence pertaining to any purported downstream pass through of defendants' conspiratorial overcharges as irrelevant under the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act. Kellogg claims that evidence of any purported pass through of overcharges is irrelevant under the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act as it is neither an affirmative defense nor an element of the plaintiff's damages claim.
"This week I'm off to Ascona for a brief, three day holiday. Whilst I'm chuffed to be getting away for a few days, I'm always faced with the debacle of what to pack, and, more specifically, what makeup to pack. Because I'm only away for a few days, I had to streamline my beauty packing down to the basics (okay, perhaps a tad more than the bare necessities) and I thought I'd share the products that I settled on.
The base: I know this seems very excessive for a short trip but I've somehow justified it to myself. The Garnier Miracle Skin Cream is a moisturiser that just gives a very slight tint with barely any coverage, making it a great base for any foundation. In order to achieve a more even complexion I've found that mixing the Erborian CC Créme HD and the Erborian BB Créme gives a dewy finish with a good amount of coverage. Lastly the Collection Lasting Perfection Concealer generally comes with me on every trip - it's a super cheap product that gets the job done without any faff.
Complexion powders: To set everything in place I mostly reach for the Bourjois Healthy Balance Powder, it mattifies the t-zone without looking cakey and has really great lasting power. Sleek's Blush by Three in the shade Lace is ideal for holidays because it contains three different cheek shades that will go with most makeup looks, all in one nifty little palette! The Catrice Matt Bronzer is the bronzer I'm currently using. It's very warm toned and gives the impression of a sunkissed complexion, perfect for people like me, whose faces inexplicably refuse to tan. Lastly, theBalm Mary-Lou Manizer is my highlighter of choice. It's a great shimmery champagne highlight without a trace of glitter.
Eyes and brows: I think I managed to restrain myself fairly well here *pats self on back*. For brows I'm keeping it simple and sticking to the Maybelline Brow Drama tinted brow gel. I have fairly unruly brows that have a tendency to rebel and this keeps them in place all day. Thumbs up. In terms of eye shadow, I've packed MAC's Painterly Paint Pot as an eyeshadow base, it has a fantastic formula and keeps eyeshadow from creasing. The NARS St Paul de Vence Eyeshadow Duo will also be making an appearance on the trip. The two eyeshadow colours in this mini-palette are summery orange-tones that pair well with a bronzed face and a nude lip. My mascara choice is fairly predictable for me, Ive been using Benefit's They're Real! mascara for years now. It doesn't smudge, it holds a curl and it's almost waterproof - what's not to love?
Lips: Now this is where I'm very proud of my streamlining skills. When it comes to lip products my self restraint is close to nothing. I collect lipstick, lip balm and lipgloss like it's nobody's business and over the course of a month I'll end up with ten or so rattling around my handbag at once. Not ideal, I am aware. That's why I'm very pleased that I've whittled the choices down to just two. Firstly, the Chanel Coco Shine in Scénario. I picked this up recently in a sale and it seems to go with almost every makeup look. The other lipstick is MAC Velvet Teddy, a firm favourite of mine that is diminishing at an alarming pace and I will therefore be using it sparingly!
That's it for my travel makeup bag, I think I've been fairly reasonable in most categories and shan't need reinforcement when transporting my luggage. Now I just have to resist the temptation of chucking in another ten lip products before I leave!",What are the two lip products the author decided to pack for their trip?,The two lip products the author decided to pack for their trip are the Chanel Coco Shine in Scénario and MAC Velvet Teddy.

The idea of “emotional quotient,” or EQ, is making a surprising comeback in the business world. Also called emotional intelligence, EQ is the ability to understand other people, what motivates them, and how to work cooperatively with them. Worthy enough, but why would this be rising in importance at a time when we are so focused on advances in artificial intelligence, the impact of increased automation, and the possibilities of machine learning? As machines increasingly take over jobs and complex decisions once the exclusive domain of people, it would not be so far-fetched to think that we are entering a “post-human” or at least “post-EQ” world.
Instead, and perhaps ironically, digitalization is fueling a renaissance in EQ. As digitalization, broadly defined, continues its revolutionary march through the business world, it brings profound implications for the human workforce. If we thought EQ was an “or,” it’s actually turned out to be an “and.” Rather than sideline EQ, digitalization has actually made it more important.
Let’s look first at the data (of course). The evidence shows that if you care about generating and sustaining results in your business, you should also care a whole lot about EQ. A recent study by my colleagues at Bain & Company found that companies that achieve or outperform their stated ambition are focused on the “people” side of the ledger, and significantly so. Culture, behavior change, management alignment, and dynamic capability building surface to the top as critical factors for success. This remains true even as we increasingly automate our businesses. A 2018 study from Singapore Management University found 87% of respondents agreed that culture created bigger barriers to digital transformation than technology, and 80% of C-Suite interviews highlighted the importance of purposefully focusing on “people aspects” during digital transformation journeys.
My recent experience with a large multinational bank is a good illustration of EQ’s revenge. Technology is dramatically changing the banking industry, especially on the retail side. Like most of its peers, this particular bank knew it would need far fewer retail branches as banking moved to phones and online. The CEO hired a chief digital officer, invested millions in a new online platform, and had grand plans to move a significant portion of its customer base toward internet banking.
But as the boxer Mike Tyson once famously said, “Everybody has a plan ‘til they get punched in the mouth.” The bank’s numbers just didn’t move as they were supposed to, frustrating and perplexing the executive team. Despite all the money put into the new, impressive digital platform, employees and customers kept doing a lot of what they’d always been doing. To change behavior, the bank’s employees needed new skills, and their customers needed new routines. None of this was in “the plan,” but it didn’t take this management team long to realize that to accelerate progress, they needed to think about the problem from the human perspective—that of the customer and employee—not just from the standpoint of what was technically possible.
As management shifted focus, the numbers started to improve. Managers realized, for example, that if a customer representative in a branch engaged at least once a day with an online adviser to resolve a customer issue in real time, both the employee and the customer became more comfortable with the new digital platform. As a result, the company began to realize more of the expected savings, customers grew to appreciate the convenience of online banking, and branch employees gave better service. Subsequent leadership debates shifted from pure technology to more human considerations. After all, organizations don’t adopt technology, people do.
With technology increasingly automating routine white-collar tasks, the ability to apply human judgment, inspiration, and creativity carries an even higher premium. Consider, for example, the demographic and societal changes fueling the next generation’s desire to work with organizations with a clear and compelling mission. Part of the psychology behind this shift is the natural human desire for stability and predictability. Against the backdrop of technology-driven change and workforce fluidity, a strong and unchanging organizational purpose or mission provides a solid foundation. Emotional connection, empathy, and the capacity to motivate all take on new importance.
Business concepts that have their roots in technology, like distributed innovation, can also require new ways of managing and unlocking human ingenuity. I hear this all the time from executives across industries, including in the not-for-profit sector. Medair, a global emergency relief and humanitarian nongovernmental organization I collaborate with closely, illustrates the value of pairing distributed innovation with a front line that displays strong EQ. To bring innovative sanitation, health and energy solutions to those in greatest need in areas devastated by conflict, drought or natural disaster, Medair leverages its people-to-people orientation on the front lines. It brings insight and innovative ideas from the field back to headquarters, where Medair taps into a strong network of technologically cutting-edge institutions, both academic and private. Collaborating with these universities and organizations, Medair has developed effective approaches to such critical challenges as clean drinking water and proper nutrition.
Clarity on how digital disruption affects your industry and your business is critical. It is even more important to develop a clear picture of the implications for your workforce, their required capabilities, and your leadership style. Just when one might have thought technology was taking over, human considerations have assumed new forms and importance. Think of it as EQ’s revenge in the digital age.",What is the impact of digitalization on the importance of emotional quotient (EQ) in the business world?,"Digitalization is fueling a renaissance in EQ.

"""Oh no! My pet's been poisoned!""
With the dust settling after the hectic festive season, we’re all catching our breath again, if we can! It is the cough and cold season and we may be reaching for cold and flu remedies to keep us going. These may well help us to carry on regardless, but if our pets are exposed they could become unwell, and while one tablet might not seem much to us, given the generally much smaller size of our pets, this can constitute a big dose for them. The last thing that anyone wants to think when they are sick is “Oh no! My pet's been poisoned!”
Why are cough and cold remedies harmful to pets?
Most cough and cold remedies will contain a painkiller. This is usually paracetamol, which can cause respiratory difficulties and harm the liver in our pets, particularly in cats, or ibuprofen, which can cause serious stomach upset or ulcers as well as kidney problems.
They may also include a decongestant in these products, which may cause excitation and agitation, panting and racing heart rate as well as changes in blood pressure and increased body temperature.
What other remedies are harmful to our pets?
Some people find it helps to inhale essential oils (menthol, eucalyptus and camphor) to clear those stuffy noses and heads, but if your pets ingest essential oils these can be very irritating to the stomach. They may develop vomiting and there is a risk of these types of products accidentally going into the lungs and causing breathing difficulties.

"Gang crime fell sharply in the first half of the year in the San Fernando Valley, especially in North Hollywood, but homicides ticked up slightly, according to LAPD figures released Wednesday..
The chief said he was confident that the department's growing number of officers and the reining in of criminal gangs that traditionally account for the bulk of homicides would lead to fewer killings in 2008 over last year.
As of June 30, 193 people had been killed in the city, compared with 185 the year before. The Valley reported 37 homicides in the period, compared with 34 in the six-month period last year.
Gang crimes were down 15 percent overall in the city and 20 percent in the Valley. The North Hollywood and Devonshire divisions led the declines with 48 percent and 37 percent declines, respectively.
Gang homicides also are down despite several high-profile gang-related killings, including the slaying of 17-year-old Jamiel Shaw Jr., which sparked a heated debate over race, gangs and immigration.
Bratton has attributed the drop in gang crime to the buildup of officers in high-crime areas, work with interventionist groups and cross-agency cooperation.
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa echoed the chief.
""There are more cops in our neighborhood, more resources on the ground and more young people moving toward a brighter future,"" he said. ""These numbers paint a picture of progress for our communities.""
In the city, gang homicides have decreased 13 percent and in the Valley they fell 35 percent over last year. Still, the percentage of young people among the dead has risen.
Last year, Bratton and Villaraigosa, who stood side by side during Wednesday's conference, named gangs as public enemy No. 1. They created lists of the Top 10 most-targeted gangs and most-wanted gangsters and the mayor appointed the Rev. Jeff Carr to be the city's gang czar.
Villaraigosa took over the city's troubled gang program and this year launched his first initiative, Summer Night Lights, modeled after a program that ran last year in Glassell Park.
The late-night summer youth programs will run in eight parks in some of the city's roughest and poorest neighborhoods, including Pacoima. The $1 million privately funded program offers sports, art and dancing for young people who often have access to few other free activities.
The mayor is expected to unveil later this week contracts with six agencies to develop new prevention and intervention programs.
""Every day, our communities and the LAPD are working closer and better than ever before, and it's yielding better results,"" the mayor said.
But for some, the help can't come soon enough.
""The resources are still not there for really dropping crime, and there's unreported crime, graffiti and robberies,"" said Moises Carillo, who, fed up with gangs, founded the Sylmar Youth Task Force last year. ""Things are on the right track. But, we still have a way to go until we have some impact.""
LAPD Cmdr. Jerry Szymanski, second in charge in the Valley, said police have made hefty strides since last year. A violent-crime task force formed as part of the gang crackdown has helped reduce gang crime in tough areas, and the addition of 35 officers to the Safer Cities Initiative in Panorama City also has helped tame gang activity.
But Szymanski said the summer months - traditionally the most violent - are still ahead.
""Right now we have some pretty significant reductions but by no means are we satisfied,"" he said. ""Statistics mean nothing to the people that were killed and their family.""

Manufacturers also conduct load testing to ensure that products that are designed to be stacked will be safe at the store and in your home. Package testing involves a lot of different types of tests to ensure that food and beverage products are ready for consumption. Opening tabs, closing lids, tearing off handles, and pulling open bags are just some of the functions that must be tested. The package itself needs to be strong and durable, yet easy enough for anyone to open.

"OK, when John McCain is finally willing to characterize Obama accurately without worrying about being called a RAAAAACIST!, it looks to me like a watershed moment all-around.
I blame Bush.
Updated, 1/9/10, Sat.:
Patterico had a guest post in 2008 featuring a letter dated February 6, 2006, from Sen. McCain to his new colleague, Obama, showing that McCain actually had Obama’s character sussed out correctly almost as soon as Obama set foot in the Senate. Here’s how it begins — and it gets better as McCain continues, so be sure to read the whole thing:.
Too little too late from the camera-chasing, aisle-hopping Senatorial lightweight who cost us the last election.
.-= Richard McEnroe´s last blog ..This Fool Thinks He’s Accomplished Something… =-.
Ace said it all: he’s as annoying as Colin Powell can be. And I did realize that it is easier for people to forgive evildoing than forgiving real stupid behavior. He had his time and place to do this. Now this is plain stupid.
.-= Dr. sipmac´s last blog ..Bono, llegó tu turno =-.
Yes Yes, agreed…I understand the cries that this is too little, too late.
But I am still SO GLAD to see an elected politician in Washington finally beginning to reveal this fact about Obama and his administration. As much as I hate to say it, I do understand why the republican politicians couldn’t really say this yet (or until recently). Had they begun saying this prematurely, the media would have (and, yes, still will) killed them – mocked, degraded and vilified to no end as not only a crazy right wing extremist, but also one who’s gone certifiably insane (dementia? conspiracy theorist? schizophrenia? stopped taking the meds?), while also risking alienating those who would eventually come to understand that what McCain is now saying is true. Speaking prematurely held great risks, potentially damaging to the cause of saving this country. I can see how McCain thought he had to wait for a large enough of a base of people to come to understand that Obama et al are Cloward & Piven Alinsky-ites trying to destroy this country.
For months now – once the Tea Partiers gained sufficient steam and we knew there were millions out there who’d been awakened – I have been thinking, Republicans (and alleged Blue Dogs), where’s the strong language? Where’s the fist pounding? Where are the raised voices? Where’s the anger? The passion? The TRUTH?!
Timing, here, is a bit of a delicate dance.
So Mr. McCain, yes, it’s time. Get your other republican politicians on board too. We are ready for our elected public officials to pick up the plot lines Rush, Beck, Sowell, etc. have shown us. And while the media will go after you to no end, we’re now wise to the media’s ways and will defend you at every turn, and you will earn our respect and support.
GET MAD. And spread the truth!
“I can see how McCain thought he had to wait for a large enough of a base of people to come to understand that Obama et al are Cloward & Piven Alinsky-ites trying to destroy this country.”
Proving that John McCain has never ever been a leader in Washington.

"After two years of theory and practical research in a countryside house, Harry Baldissera founds Paciu Maison, an art factory and a place of cultural promotion based on the concept of ""rizoma"" (Deleuze-Guattari), an acentric system where every point is linked to the others, but every trait of the system doesn't refers to similar ones. Painter, sculptor, scenographer, designer: Baldissera works experimenting different tecniques, and the most used is fabric mixed with plaster. The majority of his artworks reflects the concept of ""palimpsest"" of Gérard Genette:
continuous developing or reclaiming from a starting idea, changing its features without modifying its essence. His goal is creating an identity of recollections, perceiving the idea of art in constant evolution, from past to present, from memory to oblivion.
1- Where does the idea for Paciu Maison come from? What is its aim?
The idea that lies beside the foundation of Paciu Maison is the research about contemporary art, and investigating the world through the ""eye of art"". What was essential was the choice of expanding the boundaries of the art residency, overcoming the idea of ""habitable artwork"". The Maison is indeed an artwork and a place for art production.
2- How does this happen?
This kind of initiative lies with the importance of interpersonal exchange. Art is the greatest ""exchange"", the heaviest sharing which weighs on both the artist and the spectator. Art offers analysis, narration, feelings: this is what produces engagement, the ultimate ""exchange"". In a period like ours, based on individualism and addictions, the ""exchange"" is the path to freedom. The research activity lays the foundations on the planning and the promotion of events, exhibitions, art performances, focusing on the exchange between people.
3- At Paciu Maison the approach at art can be interpretated as instictual. How can you deny this statement?
The instinctive approach implicates a ""wait"". The instinctive part of human mind reveals itself thanks to feelings, searching for irrationality: it is an outburst, energy which becomes artwork, the engine of the artist. This situation needs time, because the instinct reveals itself in uncontrollable explosions. The impulsive execution of art is due to the essence of its executor and the result is unexpected. The connection between art and observer starts from the primitive fundaments of the human being.
4 – How do the rooms in Paciu Maison connect with your own life experience?
The rooms of Paciu Maison are connected in two different levels: the practical and the emotional one. The practical level is based on the choice of the materials; in most of the rooms the sense of movement and of time prevail. The emotional level connects to the ""explosions"" I have told about before. Like from a volcano, from every explosion pours out ""magmatic"" material which takes form in art, lacking chronological order. The rooms are transcribed in an emotional map: Paciu Maison becomes a map for the soul.
5 – Paciu Maison dimostra grande flessibilità e adattamento, d’altronde alla base della tua creatività vi è l’arte del “re-made” e del riuso. Mediante quale processo gli oggetti quotidiani di Paciu Maison prendono vita nell’arte?
The ready-made could be spontaneous, in case people do not have the possibility to buy or have the materials. That does not mean to follow the path of Duchamp: it is a necessity dictated by pragmatism and a need to establish connection between me and what I use. The idea is to create gold without the actual mineral: the artwork develops without the benefits of the richness of its materials.
6- Paciu Maison è “politica-sociale”, prima che “individuale-personale”, o è possibile che abbracci entrambe le visioni?
Paciu Maison embrases both visions, indeed it works at 360 degrees. Its goal is an investigation into time, society and people. Our work is a continuous training course, a path that challenges the schemes of the cliché or the routine, both as group and individuals.",What is the primary technique used by Harry Baldissera in his artworks?,The primary technique used by Harry Baldissera in his artworks is fabric mixed with plaster.

"When San Geraldo and our friend Judy worked together in the '70s, they worked with another Judy, as well. So they become known by their full names — Judy Shannon; and (the other Judy) Judy Barlup. I didn't meet Judy Barlup for some time.
After Judy Shannon and I had known each other for nearly 5 years, she was staying with us at our house in Guilford, Connecticut, and San Geraldo asked, ""Judy Shannon, do you want coffee?""
I looked around and commented, ""You can probably just call her Judy. She's the only one in the house.""
And that's when I learned about Judy Barlup. And that's when San Geraldo and Judy Shannon realized how odd this sounded to others. Of course, from that moment on I began to refer to Judy at all times as Judyshannon (one word).
However, after an evening with Tynan, Judyshannon has come to be known as Judyshannonstreetwhut (or wha). Click here if you missed that recent post and would like to have a hairball's chance in hell of understanding.
Judyshannonstreetwhut (or wha) headed home Tuesday. San Geraldo and I escorted her to the airport by train. While waiting in the airport station for our return train, I looked up and noticed for the first time that the walkways above our heads are glass. And I loved what I saw, which really has absolutely nothing to do with anything else I just mentioned.
Don't let me keep on walking on broken glass...
Love that Annie Lennox song. Didn't she sing this at the opening of the London Olympics?
Stephen:
I remember her singing ""Little Bird"" at the closing ceremonies. Did she sing this at the opening? I also love this song... and Annie Lennox in general.
I had a high school health teacher (an old maid, spinster, if you will) who did not allow any girl in high school to wear patent leather shoes... because they might reflect your underwear. She'd have a heart attack if she were below that sidewalk! (of course she'd have a heart attack if she saw any female on the streets today... bra straps showing, bare midriffs, those high heel! woooohooooo!)
Sharon:
Ah, Catholic School! I DID have those same thoughts as I snapped away, but I didn't see anything exciting.
So interesting post.
Gosia:
Thanks.
Mitchell these images are truly stunning; would you mind if I pinned one? (On pinterest of course.)
The kidling went through a phase where she loved all things Eurythmics, although she called them the Eurythmatics for some reason, lol.
Jacqueline:
Thanks! Thanks for asking! And, be my guest (but please tell your viewers where it came from). I used to have a hard time remembering the name Eurythmics. Eurythmatics would be so much easier!
Love those shots! That's what I miss about not being in an urban area, the opportunity for really cool photography. Of course, if I were in an urban area, I wouldn't have time to do photography because I'd be working in a stressful job in order to be able to afford said urban area. Phew. I need a rest...
Walt the Fourth:
I hope the stress has passed.
I decided to look at all of your photos first this time, after only reading that there were two Judys in your life, one of whom got coffee from San Geraldo in Guilford. I thought and thought and wondered how these photos were going to tie in to that thread. Sneaky guy, you! :) Loved the photos. I first thought that you had gotten a new underwater camera, and you were underwater as Jerry jumped in (oh, wait... with shoes on??).
If I ever drop by for a visit to Fuengirola, you can call me ""JudyChabo"" (long ""o""...that was a little bitty of a ditty of a song that a long-ago beau used to sing about me), or Judeet (the French pronunciation of Judith)... or Seine ;)
Judy:
And when Tynan meets you, you'll probably become known as Judychabointheskywithdiamonds...
ooooh là là!
Great photos Mitchell!
and who doesn't love Annie Lennox?! I do I do!
Jim:
Thanks. I can't wait to go back and take more pictures. The music is always incredible and that voice!",Who are the two Judys mentioned in the context?,The two Judys mentioned in the context are Judy Shannon and Judy Barlup.

"Just breathe… Seems to be the most common advice when someone is freaking out, upset, or facing something important. Is it just another inspirational fad found on every piece of art at your local Ross? Perhaps not. Turns out, research shows that deep breathing (using the diaphragm) helps to reduce cortisol levels in the body. Cortisol is also known as the stress hormone, which means that deep breaths actually does reduce stress.
Scientific studies continue to showcase the amazing benefits of practicing controlled breath. In addition to stress, studies by the Psychiatric Clinics of North America show that paced breathing has appears to reduce anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, attention deficit disorder, and even schizophrenia. Therefore, telling someone to “take deep breaths” in order to relax is actually pretty solid advice.
“The mind is the king of the senses, but the breath is the king of the mind.” – Hatha Yoga Pradipika
Today, I am walking you through four different yogic breath practices I teach my students to help find calm and focus. Read through these quick descriptions of each breath or check out the video for extra guidance.
Pranayamas Practices:
Square Breathing
This style of breathing is great for beginners and is one of my favorites for finding focus. It is not too obvious, so you can practice this one anywhere – at your desk, stuck in traffic, or before a meditation practice. I use this breath specifically when I am feeling anxiety creeping into my day and I want to stop it in it’s tracks..
Alternate Nostril Breathing
Alternate nostril breathing is a common practice in yoga because it requires the practitioner to fully focus and get engaged with their breath practice. It is a great technique for calming down and balancing the right and left side of the brain. Additionally, studies show that alternate nostril breathing can hold control blood pressure. However, I would skip this practice if you are dealing with sinus problems.
To practice, sit comfortably and relax the shoulders. I use my right hand, but you are welcome to switch to left (simply reverse the instructions). Bring your right hand to your nose, placing the thumb on the right side of the nose and the smallest two fingers on the left side. Place the index and middle finger in at your third eye, between the eyebrows.
To inhale, use your fingers to close the left side of the nose, breathing in through the right. Hold the breath at the top of the inhale for one or two seconds. To exhale, close the right side of the nose and exhale through the left. Inhale back through the left side, holding at the top, and exhaling through the right. Continue to repeat this pattern for 10-30 rounds.
Breath of Fire
Breath of Fire, also called Skull Luster, is a common practice in Kundalini Yoga. It is an intense breath, but has amazing benefits. Not only does it increase focus, but it also helps with detoxing the body and building strength in the core. It is also called fire breathing because it quickly builds heat in the body, which is great when you want to do a quicker warm up to begin your yoga practice or work out. This breath is not suggested if you are practice or regularly experience vertigo.
To practice, sit comfortably in a chair, on the floor with the legs crossed, or on your knees (sitting on the heels). Take a deep breath in, moving the air into the belly and allowing it to expand outwards like a balloon. To exhale, use the abdominal muscles to press the belly button into the spine and push the air out. As you begin to feel comfortable with the movement, begin shortening the breath more and more. Try to make the inhale and exhale the same length..
Video Instructions
While the four breathing practices mentioned above all have amazing benefits, simply taking long, deep breaths can be just as powerful. When you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or stressed, slow down and count your breath. Try to make each breath longer than the one before it. Use your breath to control your mind.

DanielLee55555 replied to pianoman's topic in Pattaya ForumMalinitour Apartments are really close to the beach, the prices are the lowest in this segment. Check the photos, I think it is a very good offer for families, there are even kitchens in apartments so that it won't be a problem even to cook something.
DanielLee55555 replied to dblaisde's topic in Bangkok ForumIf still actual, check Shanghai Mansion Bangkok , very decent hotel, I think. My fam and I stayed there last September, I was impressed cos it is positioned as 4 stars hotel, but the whole impression was like from 5*****. Prices are rather affordable, I think ( starting from about 70$ ).

DanielLee55555 replied to soistalker's topic in Bangkok ForumVolve hotel will be suitable to you, I guess. The price is rather loyal comparing to other hotels. As been already mentioned above, you can really cook all this in a microwave.
