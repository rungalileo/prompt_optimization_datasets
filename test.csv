"In Professor Plum's biology class there are 40 students. Of those students, 80 percent have puppies. Of those who have puppies, 25% also have parrots. How many students have both puppies and parrots?","We start with the initial numbers of students, 40 and multiply that by .8 for 40 * 0.8 = <<40*0.8=32>>32 who own puppies.
That the number of students with puppies, 32, and multiply that by .25 to find out how many own both puppies and parrots, 32 * 0.25 = <<32*0.25=8>>8 who own puppies and parrots.
The answer is <<8=8>>8.

"Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?","First find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles
Then do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles
Now add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles

"Running for 2 hours, Jonah burnt 30 calories every hour. How many more calories would he have lost if he would have run for five hours?","When Jonah ran for 2 hours, burning 30 calories every hour, he burnt a total of 2*30=<<2*30=60>>60 calories.
If he had run for five hours, losing 30 calories every hour, Jonah would have burnt 5*30=<<5*30=150>>150 calories.
The difference in the number of calories Jonah would have burnt if he ran for five hours instead of 2 hours is 150-60=<<150-60=90>>90 calories.

"The city of Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria. Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon. If Richmond has 3000 people, how many people are there in Beacon?","Victoria has 3000-1000=<<3000-1000=2000>>2000 people.
Beacon has 2000/4=<<2000/4=500>>500 people.

"To get his fill of oysters, Crabby has to eat at least twice as many oysters as Squido does. If Squido eats 200 oysters, how many oysters do they eat altogether?","If Squido eats 200 oysters, when Crabby eats twice as many oysters as Squido does, he eats 2*200 = 400 oysters.
Together, they eat 400+200 = <<400+200=600>>600 oysters.
